  <h2 class="h2">Common Standards</h2>

  <p class="tx">We have said that to meaningfully compare the value of different consequences, we have to find some
    kind of standard or unit of measurement common to all of the outcomes.</p>

  <p class="tx">There is an old fairy tale that illustrates this principle: <a href="#tip1-1"

      <h2 class="h2">Argument</h2>
      <p class="tx">In philosophy, an argument is a set of claims. Some of these claims, called the premises,
        serve as support for another claim, called the conclusion. This is different than the ordinary meaning
        of an argument as a verbal quarrel or disagreement, often characterized by raised voices and flaring
        emotions. One can think of an argument in the philosophical sense as the methodical and well-researched
        defense of a position or point of view advanced in relation to a disputed issue.</p>

  <p class="tx">Marketing is the process that involves all of a firm&#x2019;s activities to get its customers to buy
    its goods or services. In return, customers get value for their money from buying the firm&#x2019;s goods or
    services. Marketing is the heart and soul of a successful business plan. A business that does not include a
    marketing plan is more likely to fail. One can look at marketing as a process that involves a wide range of
    activities. A marketer&#x2019;s role is to carry out all the activities of marketing. </p>

      <p class="tx">Suppose you go to the store and purchase a particular product, or a friend calls you and tells you
        about how good a product is that he or she has used; all of these activities involve marketing. We are all
        involved in marketing. We are doing it all the time. Marketing has been a part of our life since we learned how
        to
        buy things.</p>

  <p class="tx">The American Marketing Association (AMA) defines <strong>marketing</strong> as &quot;the activity, set
    of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value
    for customers, clients, partners, and society at large&quot; (<a class="link" target="_blank"
      href="http://Marketingpower.com">Marketingpower.com</a>, 2001). This definition includes the term
    <em>value</em>, which this chapter will explore in depth.</p>

  <p class="tx">Value is the fundamental concept on which marketing is based. <strong>Value</strong> is the perceived
    trade-off between benefits and the sacrifice required to take possession of those benefits&#x2014;a relationship
    that constantly changes based on shifting circumstances.</p>
  <p class="tx">Marketing activities are intended to convince would-be buyers that they have found a good
    value&#x2014;a satisfactory trade-off&#x2014;and so should exchange their money for that value.
    <strong>Exchange</strong> is key to achieving the objectives of marketing. Exchange is characterized by trading
    things of value between buyer and seller so that each perceives him- or herself as better off after
    the&#xA0;trade.</p>

  <p class="tx">If a company is sufficiently complex, it may organize itself around product groups (associated items
    that consumers might use together, or think of as similar) within the business portfolio. Unilever, for example,
    is organized into three separate units that control its product groups for food and drink, home care, and personal
    care products. Within its food and drink unit are separate subunits organized to provide all the functions
    required to produce and market different product lines. Each develops its own corporate strategy but takes
    direction from the parent company. </p>


  <a id="p35"></a>
  <p class="tx">The full collection of items offered by the company is referred to as its <strong>product
      mix</strong>, or assortment (see Figure 2.1).</p>

  <p class="tx">No matter the size or organizational structure of a firm, business portfolio planning requires first
    analyzing the current portfolio to determine how much support each SBU deserves. Then planners must decide what
    the future portfolio should be.</p>

  <p class="tx">The ideal business portfolio reflects the company&#x2019;s strengths and leverages opportunities in
    the marketing environment. To achieve healthy cash flow over both the short and long term, a company&#x2019;s
    portfolio should have some products that are growing faster than others and some that have a greater
    <strong>market share</strong> than others.</p>
