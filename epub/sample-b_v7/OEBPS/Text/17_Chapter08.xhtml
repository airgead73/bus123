<h1 class="ct">Persuasive Writing</h1>
</div>
    </div>
<p class="tx">Much of the time when we communicate—either through speech or through writing—we are trying to persuade. Think about these situations:</p>

<p class="listb1"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images"/><span class="space"/>We want our boss to give us a raise.</p>
<p class="listb"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images"/><span class="space"/>We want a friend to join us at Starbucks.</p>
<p class="listb"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images"/><span class="space"/>We want a potential voter to agree with our candidate.</p>
<p class="listb"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images"/><span class="space"/>We want a consumer to buy our product.</p>
<p class="listb"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images"/><span class="space"/>We want a legislator to concur with our position.</p>
<p class="listb"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images"/><span class="space"/>We want a certain someone to go out with us.</p>

<p class="tx">All of these are examples of trying to persuade someone about something.</p>
<p class="tx">We have been exposed to and practiced persuasion all our lives. As infants, we learned that crying was a successful way to get our needs met. As we became adults, our needs became increasingly complex, and so did the strategies we used to persuade others to meet them. 
One way to persuade is through writing. You may be assigned persuasive and argumentative papers in your college courses. You may need to put together a cover letter or résumé. You may have to write a persuasive e-mail or proposal. Regardless, when writing persuasively, your objective is to promote action. You want the person receiving your message to adopt your position, buy your product, endorse your nomination, and so on. </p>
<p class="tx">When writing persuasively, you must first consider the following:</p>

<p class="num1">1.<span class="space"/><strong>Whom are you attempting to persuade?</strong> Who is your target audience? What is its makeup? What do your audience members believe now about what you’re trying to persuade them to think or do? What predispositions do they bring to the argument? What about this argument concerns them? What do they like or dislike about it? What are the important issues for this group? For example, if a CEO is addressing employees on what they must do to succeed, the audience is solidly “with” the speaker in wishing to achieve the desired goal. On the other hand, if the CEO addresses a hostile committee of Congress, the audience is much more skeptical. Knowing the audience you’re writing for before you start is essential.</p>
<p class="num">2.<span class="space"/><strong>What is the essence of your argument?</strong> What is your thesis, your central idea, the heart of what you are trying to persuade people to do? Clearly conceiving your main argument may take time, but it is worth the struggle so that you can clearly articulate what you want people to do and why it is in their best interests.</p>
<p class="num">3.<span class="space"/><strong>What do you have to back up your argument?</strong> Do you have facts to back up your point of view? Statistics? Examples? Illustrations? Anecdotes? Experience? It is, of course, critical to have passion for your argument—but passion can only go so far. You must have logical evidence to back up your arguments so that even skeptics must pay attention.</p>
<p class="num">4.<span class="space"/><strong>What are the key messages to corroborate your argument?</strong> Once you have gathered your supporting material, you are ready to craft the key messages that will add heft to your main argument. These should be written as creatively and provocatively as possible in order to be remembered.</p>
<p class="num">5.<span class="space"/><strong>What are viable alternatives to your position?</strong> Finally, in framing your argument and backing it up, you must also consider the other options or alternatives that may be available if your position is not adopted. These alternative ideas are, by definition, inferior to your position—else why would anyone adopt your persuasive argument? You must refute these arguments in a rational way so that objective observers can see that your position is best.</p>


<h1 class="h1" id="sec101">8.1 Three Means of Persuasion</h1>
<p class="tx">In <i>Rhetoric</i>, Aristotle (350 BCE) identified three different methods or means of persuasion. He suggested that we can try to persuade based on the character of the person making the persuasive appeal (<i>ethos</i>), through emotion (<i>pathos</i>), or through logic (<i>logos</i>). </p>
<p class="tx">For example, suppose your dentist says, "You need to floss your teeth every day and brush twice a day. I'm a dentist, so I should know." She is using her credentials to persuade you to adopt better dental hygiene. However, if your dentist says, "Brush your teeth—it will make you feel good," she is appealing to your emotions. Finally, if she says, "Flossing your teeth once a day and brushing twice a day has been proven to reduce cavities," and then hands you a brochure about the findings of a study on flossing, she is using logic to persuade you. </p>
<h2 class="h2">Appealing to the Character of the Writer</h2>
<p class="tx">The primary reason advertisers hire famous athletes or celebrities to endorse their products is that audiences think they have credibility. Basketball superstar Michael Jordan was a credible spokesperson for athletic shoes because he was a great athlete, audiences believed he knew a lot about sneakers, and they trusted him to tell them the truth. Celebrities who become embroiled in scandals often lose the public's trust and, correspondingly, their lucrative product endorsement deals. Losing credibility diminishes the effectiveness of any persuasive message.</p>
<p class="tx">To have credibility as a writer, your readers must perceive you as knowledgeable, believable, trustworthy, and qualified to write on the subject. If your topic is something you have experienced personally or are an expert about, state this in your writing; it helps establish your credibility. However, you need not have personal knowledge or be an expert on a subject to write about it. You can support your statements by conducting research and using evidence to back up what you say. Evidence consists of personal examples, facts, statistics, or quotations from credible authorities or other believable sources. Opinions are not legitimate pieces of evidence. Anyone can state an opinion. However, if a writer supports an idea with careful evidence, it is no longer an opinion but a supported interpretation. Make sure you supply supporting evidence whenever you state your opinion or are not an expert on a subject. Also make sure to give credit to any sources you consult.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Appealing to Emotion</h2>
<p class="tx">To be persuasive, we must often be emotional—that is, we must touch people's hearts as well as their minds. People's feelings influence their actions. Some common emotional appeals are listed here. As you read this list, think of advertisements you have encountered that feature these appeals.</p>

    
<p class="listb"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images"/><span class="space"/><strong>Fear.</strong> Appeals to emotion frequently involve fear—specifically, the fear of losing family members, a home, or belongings due to theft or natural disaster; becoming seriously ill or injured; being assaulted; being injured in a traffic accident; being rejected or disliked; or experiencing economic hardship or losing a job.</p>
<p class="listb"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images"/><span class="space"/><strong>Compassion.</strong> Requests to contribute to earthquake victims, victims of domestic violence, abused or neglected animals, starving children, and other such causes tap into humans' capacity for compassion.</p>
<p class="listb"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images"/><span class="space"/><strong>Pride.</strong> People's sense of pride in their country, family, community, ethnic heritage, or personal accomplishments can motivate them to take action. This appeal is often coupled with the appeal to self-gratification—for example, the idea that "You deserve it!" or "You've earned it!"</p>
<p class="listb"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images"/><span class="space"/><strong>Anger.</strong> Anger can be directed toward anyone—for example, suspected terrorists, government officials, business executives who receive large bonuses when their companies are in trouble, or thieves and other criminals.</p>
<p class="listb"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images"/><span class="space"/><strong>Shame.</strong> People often feel ashamed of themselves for not helping people less fortunate, for having material possessions while others go without, for not doing their best, for not living up to others' expectations, or for not conforming to ideals set by their families or religious teachings.</p> 
<p class="listb"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images"/><span class="space"/><strong>Admiration or love of others.</strong> Many emotional appeals are aimed at the basic human need to be liked, be admired, find love, and belong. We humans are social creatures, and others' opinions of us can serve as a powerful motivator.</p>

    
<p class="tx">People have many emotions, so this list is not all-inclusive. Keep in mind that people are often persuaded to act in ways they think are in their best interest and that meet their own needs. Appealing to your readers' emotions can engage them in an issue and show them how their actions will personally benefit them. This can be a powerful way to obtain support for the ideas you propose.</p>
<p class="tx">One way to incorporate emotional appeals in persuasive writing is to use <i>rhetorical devices</i>, which aim to achieve a particular effect. Rhetorical devices can help capture and hold a reader's attention and improve the impact of a writer's statements. They can be used to help a reader imagine a scene or picture specific details. The following table lists some examples of common rhetorical devices that can improve persuasive writing, when used sparingly.</p>

<p class="tx">These devices should subtly imply a point; be careful not to overuse a rhetorical device. The following sentence illustrates why:</p>
<p class="blockquote">Peter's report fails to persuade the people who oppose his perspective because his points lack punch and the paragraphs lack pizzazz.</p>
<p class="tx">This writer uses so much alliteration that, by the end, the text reads almost comically rather than genuinely. Take care not to overuse any tone or writing technique—doing so can compromise the piece's seriousness or credibility.</p>

<h4 class="head4">Appealing to Reason</h4>
<p class="tx">You may be a credible voice on a topic, and you may skillfully feature emotion in your writing. However, if what you write does not make sense or is unreasonable, you will not win over your readers. This is why reason is an important component in persuasive writing. The use of reason and analysis can be very convincing. Before readers can be persuaded to change their thoughts, they must believe what you say makes sense, is factual, and sounds reasonable.</p>
<p class="tx">Suppose you want to persuade people to exercise to improve their health. You might support your point of view with the pieces of evidence in the following table.</p>

<p class="tx">When writing persuasively, you also must take care to avoid using logical fallacies in making your argument. A logical fallacy is an error or flaw in reasoning. Although fallacious arguments seem plausible and often are quite persuasive, they are essentially unsound. Fallacies are not always a deliberate effort to deceive readers, but because they are so easily constructed, we have to be aware of what they are and how to avoid them in our own writing. Writers may inadvertently introduce a fallacy into their writing by not having solid support, using ambiguous words, or even not examining their own reasons and understanding of the topic. The following table offers a summary of the most common logical fallacies and examples of each.</p>

<p class="tx">Rhonda and Sam are on their way to the bowling alley one Saturday afternoon. It is hot outside, and Sam is thirsty. When they arrive, Sam goes to the snack bar to get a drink. Rhonda advises Sam to buy a bottle of water because it is a healthy and economical choice. Sam replies, “Pepsi is better! I saw a commercial with Beyoncé drinking Pepsi, so it has to be good.”</p>
<p class="tx">Which logical fallacy did Sam use in trying to convince Rhonda that soda is just as good as water? If you guessed <i>appeal to authority</i>, you are correct.

<h1 class="h1" id="sec102">8.2 Thinking About Tone and Language</h1> 
<p class="tx">The words we choose to express our attitudes and opinions say a lot about the intelligence of our arguments and the persuasiveness of our writing. Be sure to choose your words carefully. Bear in mind that different audiences will be persuaded by different language. For example, some words are politically sensitive. Terms like "capital punishment," "right-winger," "liberal," or "entitlement" are especially charged, depending on the audience. Knowing the words that can persuade your particular audience is critical.</p> 
<p class="tx">To be truly persuasive, writers must think about their readers, imagining a typical recipient who needs to be persuaded and remembering to write in plain English.</p>

<h1 class="h1" id="sec103">8.3 Final Tips</h1>
<p class="tx">Persuasive writing—writing in which you want to convince readers, listeners, or viewers to agree with your opinions—isn’t easy. It requires thought, practice, and passion, especially the last. You may ultimately disagree with the point of view of a really good persuasive writer, but you can’t doubt his or her sincerity or passion. A persuasive writer must also present content that invites people to read. In an Internet era in which millions publish their own blogs, the more shareable the content, the more readers are reached and potentially persuaded. The following types of content tend to work best:</p>

<p class="listb"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images"/><span class="space"/><strong>Lists.</strong> People love lists.
