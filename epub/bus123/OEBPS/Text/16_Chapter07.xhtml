        <p class="noindent2"><span class="big">This section offers guidance</span> on writing technique, style, grammar,
            and punctuation. It&#8217;s not intended to be a comprehensive guide to any of these topics. Rather, it
            targets the most common errors in business writing and offers help with those areas where business writers
            struggle the most.</p>
        <p class="indent">The English language is always changing, and the rules change along with it. Not everyone is
            aware of the rules, and not everyone cares. From a practical point of view, though, you should make an
            effort to use correct English when you write at work, for two reasons.</p>
        <p class="indent">The first is that there are sticklers in every organization, with their eyes peeled for
            errors. Sometimes these people are powerful, and often they take pride in their knowledge of English. They
            can be a tremendous asset to an organization, but they can also be a pain in the neck and make you feel
            insecure about your writing. (It&#8217;s worth pointing out that sometimes these people are wrong, and will
            &#8220;correct&#8221; you when you&#8217;ve done nothing wrong.) However you feel about these sticklers, you
            have to deal with them if you work with them, and having a solid understanding of grammar, usage, and style
            can boost your confidence and improve your writing.</p>
        <p class="indent">The second, and better, reason that you should use correct English is that you really ought to
            care. If communication is part of your job, you should take pride in doing it well. In the end, it&#8217;s
            not hard to learn the difference between the active and passive voices. It&#8217;s not difficult to master
            the proper use of commas and semicolons. When you make the <span epub:type="pagebreak"
                id="page_188"></span>effort to get these kinds of things right in your writing, you&#8217;ll see some
            interesting results in yourself. You&#8217;ll feel more confident, you&#8217;ll project that confidence, and
            you&#8217;ll have greater impact through your writing.</p>

        </h2>
        <p class="noindent1">Across various surveys I&#8217;ve conducted with business writers over the past twenty-five
            years, about 70 percent of them have reported experiencing writer&#8217;s block. Writer&#8217;s block hits
            most people at one time or another. When writer&#8217;s block interferes with your productivity and leaves
            you staring at a blank screen, try these techniques to help yourself get started.</p>
        <h3 class="h3">Understand the Reason</h3>
        <p class="noindent">There&#8217;s almost always an identifiable reason behind your writer&#8217;s block. Often
            the most effective way to get yourself unblocked is to spend some time exploring <span
                class="italic">why</span> you feel you can&#8217;t write. A very common reason is not being sure exactly
            what you want to say; maybe you need to spend some time brainstorming before you start to write. Another
            common reason is lack of confidence: you&#8217;re worried that the finished product won&#8217;t be any good.
            In this case, it might help to remember that your first draft is just that&#8212;a first draft&#8212;and no
            one but you will see it. Think hard about why you&#8217;re feeling blocked, and you might just hit on a
            practical solution to the problem.</p>
        <h3 class="h3">Close the Door</h3>
        <p class="noindent">If you&#8217;re feeling distracted by noise or activity nearby, try to arrange for a place
            and a time in which you won&#8217;t be disturbed. Close your door, shut down your e-mail program and your
            web browser, turn off your phone, and tell your colleagues or your family you won&#8217;t be available for a
            while. Having some private space and time can help you focus on your writing.</p>
        <h3 class="h3"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_189"></span>Reward Yourself</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Instead of running out for coffee before you write, try making that coffee (or a piece of
            chocolate or a trip to the gym&#8212;whatever you like) your reward for putting in some quality time on your
            writing project. It&#8217;s easier to knuckle down when you know that you&#8217;ll earn something you like
            for doing the work.</p>
        <h3 class="h3">Write It for Your Grandmother</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Maybe worries about your reader&#8217;s potential reaction are making it hard for you to get
            started. If that&#8217;s the case, you can overcome your block by imagining a different reader&#8212;someone
            who&#8217;s sympathetic to you, interested in what you have to say, and unlikely to judge you harshly: your
            grandmother. Get your writing process started by imagining that you are writing for your
            grandmother&#8212;or anyone else who&#8217;s unconditionally kind. You&#8217;ll make it clear and
            straightforward, and you won&#8217;t dump a lot of jargon in. Once you have a draft, you can revise it to
            meet the more exacting standards of your actual reader.</p>
        <h3 class="h3">Write It Badly</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Are you convinced that your writing isn&#8217;t going to be any good? Then instead of
            worrying about it, go ahead and write the whole thing as badly as you can. Write it ungrammatically; use
            inappropriate vocabulary. No one but you is going to see this draft, so go wild. Once you&#8217;ve got a bad
            draft, you can revise it into a good one, and you will have had some fun in the process.</p>
        <p class="indent">Note: if you&#8217;re trying this trick in an e-mail window, fill in the &#8220;to&#8221;
            field with your <span class="italic">own</span> e-mail address, not the intended recipient&#8217;s, while
            you&#8217;re working on your draft. It&#8217;s easy to send off a draft by accident. To be extra safe, write
            your bad draft in a separate text file, then copy and paste into an e-mail when you&#8217;re done revising.
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3">Work Someplace Else</h3>
        <p class="noindent">If you get discouraged sitting in front of the computer, try writing someplace else. Grab
            pen and paper or your laptop and find an empty conference <span epub:type="pagebreak"
                id="page_190"></span>room. Try sitting in a coffee shop. Try jotting notes while you&#8217;re on the bus
            or the train. Sometimes changing your environment will change your approach just enough to help you get your
            writing task under way.</p>

                <p class="epi"><span class="italic">&#8220;I have little time to plan my writing, and it generally takes
                        a little while to perfect it. Time, as they say, is of essence.&#8221;</span></p>
                <p class="epi-r">&#8212;S<span class="small">URVEY RESPONDENT</span></p>
                <p class="noindent1s-n">Most of my clients tell me they need to get through their writing tasks faster.
                    We&#8217;re all pressed for time at work, and writing has become a critically important part of many
                    jobs.</p>
                <p class="indents-n">Here are a few tricks to help you write faster:</p>
                <p class="indents-n"><span class="italic">Use a template</span>. If you do certain writing tasks
                    frequently, take a few minutes to create a template that you can use over and over again. The point
                    here is to avoid reinventing the wheel every time you write. Your template doesn&#8217;t have to be
                    fancy&#8212;even a quick outline can help you focus and get started. Refine the template as you
                    continue to use it, to make it as efficient as possible.</p>
                <p class="indents-n"><span class="italic">Make a time for writing</span>. Mark out a time in your day
                    just for writing&#8212;for answering e-mails or working on any other writing tasks you&#8217;re
                    facing. It doesn&#8217;t have to be the same time every day; it just has to be 100 percent dedicated
                    to writing: no phone calls, no other interruptions. You can get a lot of writing done in twenty
                    minutes if there are no other demands on that time.</p>
                <p class="indents-n"><span class="italic">Think before you write</span>. It may seem counterintuitive,
                    but taking some time to plan out what you&#8217;re going to write can save you a tremendous amount
                    of time in the long run. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_191"></span>When you start writing
                    before you know what you want to say, you often end up spending more time later reworking and
                    rewriting your text.</p>
                <p class="indents-n">Finally, get into the habit of <span class="italic">proofreading</span> what
                    you&#8217;ve written. Even the most experienced writers make more mistakes when they&#8217;re in a
                    hurry. It may take a few seconds to proofread your work, but catching errors before they reach
                    others can save you a lot of time in cleaning up the confusion that can result from typos or muddy
                    expression.</p>

                            Secret to Overcoming Writer&#8217;s Block</span></a></h3>
                <p class="headb"><span class="italic">Anita Campbell</span></p>
                <p class="noindent1s-j">When you&#8217;re stuck, start talking. Literally. It&#8217;s the fastest way
                    I&#8217;ve found to get over writer&#8217;s block.</p>
                <p class="indents-j">I write a lot, each and every day. I used to struggle, staring at a blank screen.
                    Sometimes getting that first paragraph down was the hardest part. Once I got going, it wasn&#8217;t
                    so bad to finish. But jeez Louise, pushing out that first paragraph was misery. As you can imagine,
                    for someone like me&#8212;the publisher of an online journal&#8212;who communicates for a living,
                    writer&#8217;s block could seriously hamper my career.</p>
                <p class="indents-j">How did I overcome it? My secret is simple: use voice dictation technology.</p>
                <p class="indents-j">The past five years have seen huge advances in voice recognition and voice
                    activation technologies. Voice recognition has become &#8220;intelligent,&#8221; with predictive
                    text corrections that amaze me. And the good news is that there are free applications <span
                        epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_192"></span>out there, so you can experiment to see if voice
                    dictation works for you, without fronting any money to buy software.</p>
                <p class="indents-j">For example, did you know that Windows 10 has built-in voice dictation
                    capabilities? I&#8217;ve used it to dictate into a WordPress site on a Windows PC. Microsoft also
                    has an application called &#8220;Dictate,&#8221; which uses its more advanced Cortana technology to
                    let you dictate into Microsoft Office documents. Google Docs now features built-in voice typing, too
                    (under the &#8220;Tools&#8221; menu). And various Apple devices enable dictation. However, some
                    people who decide they like to dictate will opt for an advanced application, such as Dragon
                    software.</p>
                <p class="indents-j">Whatever your choice, here&#8217;s a tip: don&#8217;t try to edit immediately or
                    clean up your first sentences as soon as you start dictating. At first, just get the words flowing.
                    The goal is to get over the psychological hump. Once you have a few paragraphs dictated, then go
                    back and edit your ramblings. At that point, you might even decide to switch to typing in order to
                    finish the piece. By the time you get deep into whatever you&#8217;re writing, the dictation has
                    served its purpose. It got you over your initial writer&#8217;s block. And that&#8217;s what counts!

        <h2 class="h2" id="sec54"><a class="none" href="06_Contents.xhtml#rsec54">Editing Your Own Writing</a></h2>
        <p class="noindent1">Editing your own writing can be challenging. It&#8217;s ideal to have someone else edit
            your work for you, but that&#8217;s not always possible. These tips for self-editing will help you ensure
            that your writing is as accurate, complete, and concise as possible before you share it with the world.</p>
        <h3 class="h3"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_193"></span>Take a Break from Your Writing</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Taking a break from your writing can help you gain more perspective on it. If possible,
            leave your first draft overnight and return to it with a fresh eye the next day. If that&#8217;s not
            possible, stand up from your desk for at least a few minutes and get your mind on something else before
            returning to your writing to edit. You&#8217;ll find that the distance helps you see your draft more
            objectively.</p>
        <h3 class="h3">Pretend You're the Intended Reader</h3>
        <p class="noindent">How will your reader react to your writing? One way to help answer this critical question is
            to imagine that <span class="italic">you</span> are the intended reader of the document as you review it.
            Put yourself in your reader&#8217;s shoes. What&#8217;s your response to the document? Is the purpose clear?
            If there&#8217;s an action requested, do you know what it is and why? Is there any information missing? Is
            the tone appropriate? Imagining yourself as the recipient of the document can help you find areas for
            improvement.</p>
        <h3 class="h3">Read It Out Loud</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Reading your draft out loud is an excellent way to catch problems in your writing, including
            missing words, awkward sentences, and incomplete thoughts. Find a quiet place, and listen as you read. Your
            final draft will be better for it.

        <h3 class="h3">Proofread Carefully</h3>
        <p class="noindent">There&#8217;s no substitute for careful proofreading. Don&#8217;t trust spelling- or
            grammar-checking software to catch errors. These programs typically cannot find errors like the mistyping of
            &#8220;coed&#8221; for &#8220;code.&#8221; And they have no way to &#8220;know&#8221; the correct spelling
            of many personal or product names. Ultimately, it&#8217;s up to you to proofread your draft word by word to
            avoid any embarrassing mistakes.</p>
        <h3 class="h3">Fix Slow Beginnings</h3>
        <p class="noindent">A strong and specific beginning can engage readers and motivate them to keep reading. Use
            these tricks to help improve sentences that begin slowly, so that you&#8217;ll get your readers involved
            right away.</p>
        <p class="listb1"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />Look out for the <span
                class="bold">&#8220;blah blah blah is that&#8221;</span> sentence opening. Some writers feel they need
            to add some warm-up syllables to a sentence before they get to the point. Consider these common beginnings:
        </p>
        <p class="blockquote-indb1"><span class="italic">The point is that . . .</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote-indb"><span class="italic">It is important to remember that . . .</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote-indb"><span class="italic">It is essential that . . .</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote-indb"><span class="italic">The purpose of X is to Y . . .</span></p>
        <p class="listb1-no">Most of the time you can do without these and just get straight to the point.</p>
        <p class="listb1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_195"></span><img src="../Images/common.jpg"
                alt="images" /><span class="space" />Look out for empty words. Phrases like the ones below creep into
            our writing without our realizing it, but they don&#8217;t mean anything:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1aa"><span class="italic">In many circumstances . . .</span> (How many? Are there really
            many, or is this just noise? If you mean &#8220;often,&#8221; say &#8220;often.&#8221;)</p>
        <p class="blockquote1ab"><span class="italic">In many ways</span> . . . (How many ways? Look out for this
            one&#8212;it&#8217;s usually just filler. If you can&#8217;t answer the question &#8220;How many ways, and
            which ones?,&#8221; you&#8217;re probably just vamping.)</p>
        <p class="blockquote1ab"><span class="italic">In order to</span> . . . (This almost always means just
            &#8220;to.&#8221;)</p>
        <p class="indent1">Remember that readers may be skimming rather than reading, so it&#8217;s important to place
            the key concepts where readers can see them easily. Sentences that begin with long introductory phrases are
            not incorrect or even poorly styled, but they do tend to push the important stuff toward the end.</p>

                <h3 class="heada"><span class="bold">Writing for Mobile Devices</span></h3>
                <p class="noindent1s-n">Nearly everything you write might be read on a phone or a tablet. Website
                    content marketers and copywriters have led the way in setting best practices for writing for mobile
                    platforms. But now everything from e-mails to proposals is likely to be opened and read on a tablet
                    or a phone. Writing with mobile devices in mind shouldn&#8217;t be an afterthought; it should be a
                    routine practice. The following tips can help ensure that what you write is easy to scan on a mobile
                    screen.</p>
                <p class="indents-n"><span class="bold">Think visually.</span> This one almost goes without saying, and
                    it&#8217;s the only thing you need to remember: envision how your content is going to look on a
                    (much) smaller screen. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_196"></span>Consider that a single
                    sentence can fill the entire screen of a phone. Long paragraphs can mean scrolling and scrolling.
                    The ability to envision what your writing is going to look like on a phone screen or on a tablet is
                    the cornerstone of writing for mobile.</p>
                <p class="indents-n"><span class="bold">Front-load your content.</span> The more a reader has to scroll,
                    the more likely that reader is to give up and go do something else. Make sure you get your most
                    important content right up front. Even if you have to develop that content more fully later in the
                    document, make sure you get your main ideas out there in front.</p>
                <p class="indents-n"><span class="bold">Be concise.</span> Writing concisely is a virtue no matter what
                    delivery method you use, but on mobile screens it&#8217;s a live-or-die matter. Long sentences,
                    complex constructions, and extra words will make your reader&#8217;s experience unnecessarily
                    laborious.</p>
                <p class="indents-n"><span class="bold">Format for ease of scanning.</span> When you&#8217;re writing
                    for ordinary screens or for printing, you want to use &#173;formatting&#8212;paragraph breaks,
                    headings, bullet points, bolding&#8212;to make your content easier to scan. That&#8217;s even more
                    important for mobile platforms. Imagine that you&#8217;ve written a proposal that your potential
                    customer is viewing on his phone. If he starts reading a prose paragraph, he&#8217;s got no idea how
                    long it&#8217;s going to be, because he can&#8217;t see the whole thing. He might find himself
                    scrolling and scrolling through a long paragraph and beginning to feel lost. You can help him with
                    these formatting practices:</p>
                <p class="lists1"><img src="../Images/common1.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />Use headlines to
                    orient the reader.</p>
                <p class="lists0"><img src="../Images/common1.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />Use bulleted or
                    numbered lists where appropriate.</p>
                <p class="lists0"><img src="../Images/common1.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />Write short
                    sentences and short paragraphs.</p>
                <p class="indent1s-n-l"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_197"></span>Buddhists believe that there is
                    only the present. The past is gone, and the future is uncertain; all we have for sure is now. You
                    should adopt the same kind of thinking when you&#8217;re writing for mobile platforms. On a mobile
                    device, a reader can&#8217;t see a full document, and she can&#8217;t see the larger
                    context&#8212;all she&#8217;s got is the screen in front of her. It&#8217;s your job as a writer to
                    ensure that your content is communicated effectively on the mobile platform.</p>

                More Direct</a></h2>
        <p class="noindent1">The grammatical term &#8220;voice&#8221; refers to whether the subject of the sentence acts
            or receives the action. If the subject is doing the acting, the sentence is in the active voice (&#8220;Joe
            kicks the ball&#8221;); if the subject is acted upon, the sentence is in the passive voice (&#8220;The ball
            is kicked by Joe&#8221;). The passive voice is made up of a form of the verb &#8220;to be&#8221; and the
            past participle of another verb (e.g., &#8220;is eaten,&#8221; &#8220;are preferred,&#8221; &#8220;was
            chosen,&#8221; or &#8220;were stolen&#8221;).</p>
        <p class="indent">Writers in many different settings tend to overuse the passive voice, and the result is often

        <p class="noindent">Transforming passive constructions into active constructions is easy, and the resulting
            sentences are usually shorter, more direct, more specific, and more interesting. To change a passive
            construction into an active one, identify the person or thing that is doing the action, make it the subject
            of the sentence, and continue with any necessary alterations. You may find that the actor isn&#8217;t
            present in the sentence at all; in that case, figure out what it is and insert it.</p>
        <p class="hang1a">Passive: <span class="italic">The speaker was ignored by the audience for most of the
                presentation.</span></p>

        <p class="hang1">Active: <span class="italic">Critics judged the novel to be one of the best of the
                decade.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">Using a passive construction is <span class="italic">not</span> incorrect. In general,
            however, active constructions are more interesting and engaging to read. Becoming adept at using the passive
            and active voices will help you become a stronger and more skilled writer.</p>

                <p class="noindent1s-j">President Harry Truman once famously said, &#8220;Not all readers are leaders,
                    but all leaders are readers.&#8221; This statement certainly rings true, as influential leaders from
                    the past, including President Teddy Roosevelt and Sir Winston Churchill, frequently traveled around
                    the world with their libraries at their disposal.</p>
                <p class="indents-j">I had the pleasure of meeting Alfred W. Tatum, PhD&#8212;the dean of the College of
                    Education at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Dr. Tatum informed me that he uses a scale to
                    make sure he reads five pounds of books per month. I have personally adopted this practice and
                    encourage everyone who has leadership aspirations to read a lot, not just in their chosen fields but
                    broadly across all topics.</p>
                <p class="indents-j">However, I would take President Truman&#8217;s thought one step further and assert
                    that <span class="italic">not all writers are leaders, but all leaders are writers</span>.
                    Communication is the single most important key to leadership success. In all lines of business, the
                    ability to effectively and persuasively write and communicate is what propels the great leaders

                    &#8220;noise&#8221; in the environment makes clear communication even more important. The libraries

        <h2 class="h2" id="sec58"><a class="none" href="06_Contents.xhtml#rsec58">This What?</a></h2>
        <p class="noindent1">Here&#8217;s a quick and easy trick to help you cultivate a more engaging writing style:
            avoid using the word &#8220;this&#8221; as a stand-alone subject. &#8220;This&#8221; can be used in two
            ways.</p>
        <p class="hang1a">As a demonstrative pronoun: <span class="italic">This is difficult.</span></p>
        <p class="hang1">Or as an adjective: <span class="italic">This project is difficult.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">When used as a pronoun, &#8220;this&#8221; stands in the place of a noun. In a sentence like
            &#8220;This is difficult,&#8221; you can assume that, from the context, <span epub:type="pagebreak"
                id="page_201"></span>people know what &#8220;this&#8221; means. It&#8217;s a little harder to follow,
            however, when you try to use the pronoun &#8220;this&#8221; to stand in for something more complex than a
            simple idea. Let&#8217;s look at an example:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">We might improve the process by having the prep team notify AK
                when the first phase has been completed. This would allow AK to prepare to move the product to phase
                two. This could eliminate an entire step of the HD process.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">In the second and third sentences above, what do you figure &#8220;this&#8221; means? This
            what? In these sentences, &#8220;this&#8221; is being asked to do too much, and the result is vague, weak
            prose. Let&#8217;s look at a revision:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">We might improve the process by having the prep team notify AK
                when the first phase been completed. AK could then prepare early to move the product to phase two.
                Setting up this kind of notification system could eliminate an entire step of the HD process.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">The revision is more specific and easier to follow. Is it possible for a reader to guess what
            the original version means? Probably. Is it better not to make the reader guess? Certainly.</p>
        <p class="indent">When you&#8217;re about to use &#8220;this&#8221; to stand in for a complex idea, take a
            moment to write out what you mean explicitly. If you have trouble doing so, it&#8217;s a sign that you were
            &#8220;cheating&#8221; a little bit and expecting that little word to do the hard work you didn&#8217;t want
            to do. Taking the trouble to think through exactly what you mean will help guide your reader and make your
            point more clearly.</p>

                    first example, in which the referent &#8220;They&#8221; was unclear. Whomever or whatever you are
                    referring to should always be obvious. Make sure that you ascribe the action of the sentence to one

        <h2 class="h2" id="sec59"><a class="none" href="06_Contents.xhtml#rsec59">Gender-Neutral Language</a></h2>
        <p class="noindent1">The English language has gendered pronouns in the third person&#8212;that is,
            &#8220;he&#8221; and &#8220;she.&#8221; Once upon a time, the masculine pronouns &#8220;he,&#8221;
            &#8220;him,&#8221; &#8220;his,&#8221; and &#8220;himself&#8221; were considered acceptable for use as <span
                epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_202"></span>gender-neutral pronouns in situations where the sex of the
            person was not known:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">Everyone should lock his office door at the end of the
                day.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote"><span class="italic">The successful executive has confidence, and he can communicate
                effectively with everyone.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote"><span class="italic">A worker is only as good as his tools.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote"><span class="italic">Modern man no longer coddles himself during pregnancy. He continues
                to work often until days before he goes into labor and delivers.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">That last example calls into question the neutrality of the pronoun, doesn&#8217;t it? Today,
            the masculine pronoun is no longer considered gender-neutral, which leaves professional writers with some
            choices to make when they want to be inclusive. No one has yet developed a widely accepted gender-neutral
            English pronoun, so we&#8217;re left with a few different options when we want to write without specifying
            the gender of the person we&#8217;re talking about.</p>
        <h3 class="h3"> Use &#8220;He or She&#8221; or &#8220;She or He&#8221;</h3>
        <p class="noindent">The phrases &#8220;he or she&#8221; or &#8220;she or he&#8221; can work, especially if used
            sparingly. This construction can be clunky when it&#8217;s used in situations where the pronoun appears more
            than once in a single sentence:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">Everyone should lock his or her office door at the end of the
                day.</span></p>
        <p class="noindent1">But not:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">Everyone should lock his or her office door at the end of the
                day and ensure that he or she turns off the copier and printer.</span></p>
        <h3 class="h3">Use S/he and His/Her</h3>
        <p class="noindent">This option is typographically more efficient than using &#8220;she or he,&#8221; but it
            reads unnaturally:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_203"></span><span class="italic">The successful
                executive has confidence, and s/he can communicate effectively with everyone.</span></p>
        <h3 class="h3">Alternate Using &#8220;He&#8221; and &#8220;She&#8221;</h3>
        <p class="noindent">If you have a fairly long text that features a lot of pronouns, you can alternate using
            &#8220;he&#8221; and &#8220;she,&#8221; showing equal favor to both. That&#8217;s the primary approach
            chosen for this book. However, it won&#8217;t work if you have a string of sentences that require the
            pronoun; the alternation will seem bizarre and confusing.</p>
        <h3 class="h3">Use &#8220;They&#8221; and &#8220;Their&#8221; as Singular Pronouns</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Many writers use &#8220;they&#8221; and &#8220;their&#8221; to refer back to a singular
            subject, when the gender of that subject is unknown:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">Everyone should lock their office door at the end of the
                day.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic">Somebody got their handprints all over the bathroom mirror; they
                ought to go back and clean it off.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">Sticklers and traditionalists will point out that this construction is grammatically
            incorrect, because &#8220;everyone&#8221; is singular and &#8220;their&#8221; is plural. They&#8217;re
            right, and you should be aware that some readers won&#8217;t approve of this solution to the gender-neutral
            challenge. However, it&#8217;s an approach that many, if not most, people have adopted in everyday speech.
            There are examples of &#8220;they&#8221; used as a singular pronoun going back as far as the fourteenth
            century, and it was only in the nineteenth century that grammarians began to object to it. For us
            &#173;twenty-first-century types, using &#8220;they&#8221; as a singular pronoun is probably all right in
            most settings; in very formal writing, it might be smart to find another alternative.</p>
        <h3 class="h3">Pluralize Your Sentence</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Instead of making a plural work as a singular, and possibly alienating some readers,
            consider pluralizing the whole sentence:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_204"></span><span class="italic">Successful
                executives have confidence, and they can communicate effectively with everyone.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic">Workers are only as good as their tools.</span></p>
        <h3 class="h3">Rewrite the Sentence to Avoid Using Third-Person Pronouns</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Sometimes the best solution is to rewrite the sentence without third-person pronouns. This
            approach is always safe:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">Please lock your office door at the end of the day.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic">Whoever got handprints all over the mirror should go back and clean
                it up.</span></p>
        <h3 class="h3"><span class="bold">Be Consistent </span></h3>
        <p class="noindent">Whatever option you choose, be sure you implement it consistently; don&#8217;t switch from
            one style to another in midstream.</p>
        <p class="noindent1">Not:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">The new STEP app allows users to choose what action to take once
                he/she logs in.</span></p>

        </h2>
        <p class="noindent1">The sentence is the basic building block of writing. Fragments and runons masquerade as
            sentences, but they&#8217;re incorrect and often confusing. For clarity and correctness, you&#8217;re wise
            to use proper sentences in formal and informal writing.</p>
        <h3 class="h3">Sentences</h3>
        <p class="noindent">A sentence contains a subject and a verb and expresses a complete thought.</p>
        <p class="indent">The subject of a sentence is a noun or pronoun that names a person, place, or thing:
            &#8220;the committee,&#8221; &#8220;Justin,&#8221; &#8220;she,&#8221; &#8220;they,&#8221;
            &#8220;Scotland,&#8221; &#8220;the backyard,&#8221; &#8220;Wall Street,&#8221; &#8220;the laptop,&#8221;
            &#8220;a cat,&#8221; &#8220;a regulation.&#8221;</p>
        <p class="indent">It can also be a series of words that function as a noun, because they name a thing:
            &#8220;running the application.&#8221;</p>
        <p class="indent">A verb is a word that expresses action or a state of being: &#8220;provide,&#8221;
            &#8220;argue,&#8221; &#8220;is,&#8221; &#8220;are,&#8221; &#8220;were.&#8221;</p>
        <p class="indent">To be considered a sentence, a group of words must have both a subject and a verb:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">The committee provides guidelines for the implementation
                of</span> <span class="italic">each stage.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic">They argue a lot, but they never get anywhere.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic">The laptop is broken.</span></p>
        <h3 class="h3">Fragments</h3>
        <p class="noindent">A fragment is an incomplete sentence. It&#8217;s usually missing its subject or its verb. It
            hints at a complete thought but does not express it. For example:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">Ran the backup overnight</span>.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic">Not a full-blown detailed blueprint.</span></p>

        <!-- Zovio additional content: start. -->
        <p class="noindent">There are three ways to fix a fragment:</p>
        <p class="listbb"><span class="bold">1. </span><span class="space" />Attach the fragment to a nearby complete
            sentence.</p>
        <p class="indent3">Incorrect: <span class="italic">If the front door is locked. Use the back entrance.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="indent3">Correct: <span class="italic">If the front door is locked, use the back entrance.</span></p>

        <p class="listbb"><span class="bold">2. </span><span class="space" />Revise the fragment by adding whatever is
            missing: subject, verb, complete thought.</p>

        <p class="indent3">Incorrect: <span class="italic">Loves to lie around in the sun all day.</span> (Subject is
            missing. Who loves to lie around?)</p>
        <p class="indent3">Correct: <span class="italic">My roommate's pug loves to lie around in the sun all
                day.</span></p>

        <p class="indent3">Incorrect: <span class="italic">Joe to train everyday.</span> (Verb is missing. Also, "to
            train" is the wrong verb form.)</p>
        <p class="indent3">Correct: <span class="italic">Joe trains everyday for the marathon next month.</span></p>
        <p class="indent3">Correct: <span class="italic">Joe is training everyday for the marathon next month.</span>
        </p>

        <p class="listbb"><span class="bold">3. </span><span class="space" />Rewrite the fragment or the entire passage
            that contains the fragment.</p>

        <p class="indent3">Incorrect: <span class="italic">Our new landlord was expected to make changes. Such as fixing
                the plumbing, installing a new washer, and replacing the security gate. Has not done any of it yet and
                weeks have passed.</span></p>
        <p class="indent3">Correct: <span class="italic">Our new landlord was expected to make changes, such as fixing

        <h3 class="h3"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_206"></span>Run-ons</h3>
        <p class="noindent">A run-on sentence is two or more sentences stuck together without a conjunction (like
            &#8220;and&#8221; or &#8220;but&#8221;) or appropriate punctuation (like a semicolon).</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">Everyone came in for the meeting, there was no place to
                sit</span>.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic">There&#8217;s not much content under the first bullet maybe we
                should add a line or two</span>.</p>
        <p class="noindent1">Here are two easy ways to fix these run-ons:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">Everyone came in for the meeting,</span> <span
                class="bolditalic">but</span> <span class="italic">there was no place to sit</span>.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic">There&#8217;s not much content under the first bullet,</span> <span
                class="bolditalic">so</span> <span class="italic">maybe we should add a line or two.</span></p>
        <p class="noindent1">Or:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">There&#8217;s not much content under the first
                bullet</span><span class="bolditalic">;</span> <span class="italic">maybe we should add a line or
                two.</span></p>



        <p class="noindent">One other way to fix a run-on is to add a subordinating conjunction&#8212;also known as a
            "dependent word"&#8212;to the beginning or the middle of the sentence.</p>

        <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic"><span class="strong">Because</span> everyone came in for the

        <p class="noindent1">Pronouns are words that stand in for nouns. They can take different forms depending on what
            part they play in a sentence. Personal pronouns used as subjects take the <span class="bold">nominative
                case</span>: &#8220;I,&#8221; &#8220;you,&#8221; &#8220;he,&#8221; &#8220;she,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221;
            and &#8220;they.&#8221; Personal pronouns used as direct or indirect objects, or as objects of a
            preposition, take the <span class="bold">objective case</span>: &#8220;me,&#8221; &#8220;you,&#8221;
            &#8220;him,&#8221; &#8220;her,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;them.&#8221; Most of the time, writers
            use pronouns correctly. However, there are a few common errors you should beware.</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">Please send the finished reviews to George and</span> <span
                class="bolditalic">I</span><span class="italic">.</span></p>
        <p class="noindent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_207"></span>But:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">Please send the finished reviews to George and</span> <span
                class="bolditalic">me</span><span class="italic">.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">If alarm bells are going off in your head right now, it&#8217;s probably because you can hear
            your mother&#8217;s voice exclaiming, &#8220;George and I!&#8221; She was saying that because you said,
            &#8220;George and me are going to ride bikes,&#8221; or maybe &#8220;Me and George are going to ride
            bikes.&#8221; She was trying to get you to use the nominative case of the pronoun as the subject of the
            sentence, and she was right. In this case, however, you need the objective case. &#8220;George&#8221; and
            &#8220;me&#8221; are objects of the preposition &#8220;to,&#8221; so you need the objective case, even if it
            sounds weird.</p>
        <p class="indent">How do you know? In this case, simply drop &#8220;George and&#8221; and see how it sounds:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">Please send the finished reviews to</span> <span
                class="bolditalic">I</span><span class="italic">.</span></p>
        <p class="noindent1">You can tell that&#8217;s wrong. It&#8217;s wrong because you need &#8220;me,&#8221; in the
            objective case, as the object of the preposition &#8220;to.&#8221; So it needs to be &#8220;George and
            me.&#8221; By the same token, you can now probably see that this sentence is incorrect:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">The work was divided between</span> <span class="bolditalic">he
                and I</span><span class="italic">.</span></p>
        <p class="noindent1">Instead, you need pronouns in the objective case as objects of the preposition
            &#8220;between&#8221;:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">The work was divided between</span> <span class="bolditalic">him
                and me</span><span class="italic">.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">Another common pronoun problem is the incorrect use of <span class="bold">reflexive
                pronouns</span>. The reflexive form of the pronoun contains the word &#8220;self.&#8221; Think of the
            form <span class="bold">reflecting</span> back on itself: &#8220;myself,&#8221; &#8220;yourself,&#8221;
            &#8220;himself,&#8221; &#8220;herself,&#8221; &#8220;ourselves,&#8221; and &#8220;themselves.&#8221;
            Reflexive pronouns <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_208"></span>are used only to refer to another word
            in the sentence or to emphasize another word in the sentence.</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">I hurt</span> <span class="bolditalic">myself</span><span
                class="italic">.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic">She did all the coding</span> <span
                class="bolditalic">herself</span><span class="italic">.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">Reflexive pronouns like &#8220;myself&#8221; never stand alone. So common constructions like
            this are incorrect:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">All the results will be reviewed by Loren and</span> <span
                class="bolditalic">myself</span><span class="italic">.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic">For people like</span> <span class="bolditalic">myself</span><span
                class="italic">, keeping up with technology can be difficult</span>.</p>
        <p class="indent1">In both of these cases, &#8220;myself&#8221; is not referring to another word in the
            sentence; hence the usage is incorrect. People use &#8220;myself&#8221; in this way in an attempt to sound
            more formal and more polite, but it&#8217;s simply wrong. Those sentences should read:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">All the results will be reviewed by Loren and</span> <span
                class="bolditalic">me</span><span class="italic">.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic">For people like</span> <span class="bolditalic">me</span><span
                class="italic">, keeping up with technology can be difficult.</span></p>
        <p class="noindent1">Those versions might not sound fancy, but they&#8217;re grammatically correct.</p>
        <p class="indent">A third common pronoun controversy has to do with using &#8220;they&#8221; as a singular
            pronoun. Of course, &#8220;they&#8221; is plural form. But in order to avoid sexist writing, people have
            increasingly been using forms of &#8220;they&#8221; as a gender-neutral singular pronoun.</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">Everyone should bring</span> <span
                class="bolditalic">their</span> <span class="italic">own lunch.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic">We should let the assistant know when</span> <span
                class="bolditalic">they</span> <span class="italic">will be needed.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">There&#8217;s still some disagreement about whether this usage is acceptable in modern
            English, although more and more people (including me) consider it just fine. For a fuller discussion of this
            issue, see &#8220;&#173;Gender-Neutral Language&#8221; <a href="16_Chapter07.xhtml#page_201">here</a>.</p>

        <p class="indent1">This controversy over the use of the singular “they” is related to a common error called a
            pronoun–antecedent error. The <strong>antecedent</strong> is the noun that comes before the pronoun. As a
            rule of thumb, the pronoun should agree with its antecedent. </p>

                    id="page_209"></span>Misplaced and Dangling Modifiers</a></h2>
        <p class="noindent1">&#8220;Modifiers&#8221; are parts of speech that change, or modify, the meaning of other
            words. Adjectives modify nouns or pronouns (<span class="italic">the</span> <span
                class="bolditalic">silent</span> <span class="italic">machine; the</span> <span
                class="bolditalic">rude</span> <span class="italic">neighbor; she was</span> <span
                class="bolditalic">busy</span>). Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs (<span
                class="italic">the machine ran</span> <span class="bolditalic">silently</span><span class="italic">; the
                report was</span> <span class="bolditalic">especially</span> <span class="italic">dense; she
                spoke</span> <span class="bolditalic">very</span> <span class="italic">quickly</span>).</p>
        <p class="indent">Modifiers don&#8217;t have to be single words. They can also be phrases:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">The heater</span> <span class="bolditalic">under the desk</span>
            <span class="italic">was set on low.</span> (The phrase &#8220;under the desk&#8221; works as an adjective
            modifying &#8220;heater.&#8221;)</p>
        <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic">The operation ran</span> <span class="bolditalic">for a year</span>
            <span class="italic">without full staffing.</span> (The phrase &#8220;for a year&#8221; functions as an
            adverb modifying &#8220;ran.&#8221;)</p>
        <p class="indent1">As a general rule, modifiers should be placed as close as possible to the words they modify,
            to avoid confusion. A <span class="bold">misplaced modifier</span> is positioned in such a way that
            it&#8217;s not clear what word it&#8217;s supposed to modify. You might not notice a misplaced modifier at
            first, but once you do, the result is often nonsensical.</p>

            &#8220;which&#8221; often introduce clauses. Clauses can be restrictive or nonrestrictive. A <span

            clear which room is booked.</p>
        <p class="indent">A <span class="bold">nonrestrictive</span> clause is not essential to the meaning of a

                screen</span><span class="italic">, seats twenty-five people.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">In this example, you can drop the clause and the sentence will still retain its meaning. The
            clause is nonrestrictive.</p>
        <p class="indent">As you might infer from the examples above, &#8220;that&#8221; is used with restrictive

        <p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_213"></span>This clause is restrictive. It&#8217;s
            essential to the meaning of the sentence, so you need to introduce it with &#8220;that.&#8221; It

        <p class="indent1">The point of this sentence is that the car got two flat tires on the bridge. The fact that
            you picked it up in Memphis doesn&#8217;t matter. It&#8217;s a nonrestrictive clause, so it&#8217;s
            introduced with &#8220;which.&#8221;</p>

        <h2 class="h2" id="sec65"><a class="none" href="06_Contents.xhtml#rsec65">Split Infinitives</a></h2>
        <p class="noindent1">The <span class="bold">infinitive</span> form of a verb is the form that includes
            &#8220;to&#8221;: &#8220;to run,&#8221; &#8220;to understand,&#8221; &#8220;to process,&#8221; and so on.
            It&#8217;s called an &#8220;infinitive&#8221; because it exists outside of time&#8212;that is, it&#8217;s
            not in the present, past, or future tense. It&#8217;s the base form of the verb.</p>
        <p class="indent">A split infinitive is one where someone has inserted a word between the &#8220;to&#8221; and
            the main part of the verb. The world&#8217;s most famous split infinitive comes from the original series of
            <span class="italic">Star Trek</span>, where Captain Kirk describes the mission of the <span
                class="italic">Enterprise</span>: &#8220;To boldly go where no man has gone before.&#8221;</p>
        <p class="indent">Many of us were taught that it&#8217;s incorrect to split an infinitive. The reason for this
            is complicated and probably not interesting unless you&#8217;re a big fan of grammatical history. All you
            need to know is that there are people out there, perhaps in your office, who feel that split infinitives are
            bad grammar and that you should avoid them. In response, you can do one of two things: (1) ignore these
            colleagues and risk being dinged for bad writing, or (2) try to avoid splitting infinitives.</p>
        <p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_214"></span>If you choose the second course, consider
            moving the modifier to another place in the sentence. Often this solution works very well:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">To boldly go where no man has gone before</span> <span
                class="italic">&#8594;</span> <span class="italic">Boldly to go where no man has gone before</span></p>

                Preposition</a></h2>
        <p class="noindent1">Many people will tell you that it&#8217;s incorrect to end a sentence with a preposition.
            Others will tell you it&#8217;s not a rule at all. If you&#8217;re writing with the sticklers in mind,
            you&#8217;ll want to avoid this practice.</p>
        <p class="indent">There are several ways to rewrite a sentence that ends with a preposition.</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">For the next quarter, we need to decide which initiative to
                focus on.</span></p>
        <p class="noindent1">Use &#8220;on which&#8221;:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">For the next quarter, we need to decide on which initiative to
                focus.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">This solution can be awkward, as you can see, but sometimes it works well.</p>
        <p class="noindent1">Reorder the sentence in another way:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">We need to decide which initiative to focus on for the next
                quarter.</span></p>
        <p class="noindent1">Find another word to replace the prepositional form:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">For the next quarter, we need to decide which initiative to
                prioritize.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_215"></span>This rewrite sounds stronger than the
            initial version. Forms that contain a verb and a preposition can often be replaced with a single, stronger
            verb.</p>

        <h2 class="h2">Subject–Verb Agreement</h2>
        <p class="noindent1">Generally, the subject of a sentence should always agree with its verb. Add an "s" to the
            verb if the subject is third–person singular (he, she, it, they, Martha, Sam, etc.). Do not add an "s" if
            the subject is plural.</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">The family <strong>cat loves</strong> to be around the newborn
                baby.</span> (Singular verb = loves)</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">The family <strong>cats love</strong> to be around the newborn
                baby. </span> (Plural verb = love)</p>

        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic"><strong>He is</strong> a big fan of my father's apple
                pie.</span> (Singular verb = is)</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic"><strong>They are</strong> big fans of my father's apple
                pie.</span> (Plural verb = are)</p>


        <p class="noindent1">However, this general rule does not apply all the time. Refer to the following tips if you
            get stuck:</p>

        <p class="listbb"><span class="bold">1.</span><span class="space" />Subjects that are joined by "and." Two
            subjects that are joined by "and" usually take plural verbs. </p>
        <p class="indent3"><span class="italic">Rock climbing and step aerobics <strong>are</strong> my favorite cardio
                exercises.</span></p>

        <p class="listbb"><span class="bold">2.</span><span class="space" />Subjects that are joined by "neither…nor"
            and "either…or." When two subjects are joined by these words, the verb agrees with the subject closest to
            it.</p>
        <p class="indent3"><span class="italic"> Neither the teacher nor the <strong>students want</strong> to eliminate
                the school's recycling program.</span></p>
        <p class="indent3"> <span class="italic">Neither the students nor the <strong>teacher wants</strong> to
                eliminate the school's recycling program.</span></p>

        <p class="listbb"><span class="bold">3.</span><span class="space" />Singular nouns ending in "s" that are not
            plural. Some nouns that end in "s" are singular subjects: physics, economics, news, athletics. Use a
            singular verb.</p>
        <p class="indent3"> <span class="italic">Physics was Dustin's favorite subject in high school.</span></p>

        <p class="listbb"><span class="bold">4.</span><span class="space" />Collective nouns. Use a singular verb with a
            collective noun, such as team, family, class, union, army, committee.</p>
        <p class="indent3"> <span class="italic">My family loves to go bowling every weekend.</span></p>

        <p class="listbb"><span class="bold">5. </span><span class="space" />Words that come in between subject and
            verb. The words that come in between the subject and verb should not affect subject–verb agreement.</p>
        <p class="indent3"><span class="italic"> <strong>The new condos</strong> on Euclid Avenue, along with the work
                lofts, <strong>are</strong> for sale.</span></p>
        <p class="listbb"><span class="bold">6.</span><span class="space" />Reversed word order. Typically, the verb
            follows the
            subject in a sentence. When the order is reversed, identify the subject so that you know what verb to use.
        </p>
        <p class="indent3"> <span class="italic">There is a paycheck waiting for you in the Human Resources
                office.</span> (Hint: Think of it as, "A paycheck is waiting for you in the Human Resources office.")
        </p>

        <p class="listbb"><span class="bold">7.</span><span class="space" />Titles of works, organizations, and
            businesses. Even if the titles and names are plural in form, use a singular verb.</p>

        <p class="indent3"> <span class="italic">The Whole Foods Market chain specializes in natural products and
                organic produce.</span></p>

        <p class="noindent1">The general rule also does not apply when an indefinite pronoun is the subject. An
            indefinite pronoun is a pronoun that does not refer to a specific person, thing, or amount. Refer to the
            following tips if you're not sure what kind of verb to use.</p>

        <p class="listbb"><span class="bold">1.</span><span class="space" /> Subjects that are singular but don't look
            like they are. The indefinite pronouns in the following table are considered singular subjects. Use a
            singular verb or add an "s" to the end of its matching verb if you use these in a sentence.</p>

                            Words</span></a></h3>
                <p class="noindent1s-n">There are some words in the English language that are confusing and give all
                    writers some trouble. Mistakes regarding confusing verbs can be easily avoided with a bit of effort
                    and attention.</p>
                <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="bolditalic">Lie</span> <span class="bold">and</span> <span
                        class="bolditalic">lay</span></p>
                <p class="blockquote-n">Did you lie down or lay down? Was he laying or lying? Was it lain or laid? These
                    two verbs can be very confusing. A subject can lie down, but objects are laid down. Remember, the
                    verb that you can do to yourself has a hard &#8220;i&#8221; sound.</p>
                <p class="blockquote-indb"><span class="italic">I will lie down.</span></p>
                <p class="blockquote-indb"><span class="italic">I must lay this heavy book down.</span></p>
                <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="bolditalic">Sit</span> <span class="bold">and</span> <span
                        class="bolditalic">set</span></p>
                <p class="blockquote-n">Are you going to sit a spell or set a spell? These two verbs are very confusing
                    for people in certain regions of the United States. Just as <span class="italic">lie</span> is an
                    activity one does to oneself, <span class="italic">sit</span> is the activity people do for
                    themselves. A subject can sit down, but objects have to be set down. Here, too, the verb that you
                    can do to yourself has an &#8220;i.&#8221;</p>
                <p class="blockquote-indb"><span class="italic">I sat too long today.</span></p>
                <p class="blockquote-indb"><span class="italic">I’ll set down my drink before I spill it.</span></p>
                <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="bolditalic">Rise</span> <span class="bold">and</span> <span
                        class="bolditalic">raise</span></p>
                <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic">Rise</span>, <span class="italic">rose</span>, <span
                        class="italic">risen</span>, and <span class="italic">raised</span> all refer to the act of
                    upward movement. The verbs <span class="italic">rise</span> and <span class="italic">raise</span>
                    are different, however. Just as <span class="italic">sit</span> is an activity one does to oneself,
                    <span class="italic">rise</span> is the activity people do for themselves. A subject can rise, but
                    the objects have to be raised. Once again, the verb that you can do to yourself has an
                    &#8220;i&#8221; vowel alone.</p>
                <p class="blockquote-indb"><span class="italic">I saw that he had risen to meet her, so I decided to
                        rise, too.</span></p>
                <p class="blockquote-indb"><span class="italic">I raised the flag so he could see it from the
                        highway.</span></p>
                <p class="noindent1s-n">There are also many fake words circulating in society that occasionally make it
                    into written communication. Writers should avoid using fake words; focus on making good word choices
                    to communicate effectively.</p>
                <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="bolditalic">Irregardless</span></p>
                <p class="blockquote-n">People have used this fake word so much that it now appears in some
                    dictionaries! However, if you feel tempted to write <span class="italic">irregardless</span>, simply
                    write the real word&#8212;<span class="italic">regardless</span>&#8212;instead.</p>
                <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="bolditalic">Alot</span></p>
                <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic">Alot</span> is not a word. The phrase <span
                        class="italic">a lot</span> is two words. Remember to always write <span class="italic">a
                        lot</span> as two words, and make sure you have not added <span class="italic">alot</span> to
                    your spell-check dictionary.</p>
                <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="bolditalic">Alright</span></p>
                <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic">Alright</span> is not a word either. The phrase <span
                        class="italic">all right</span> is two words. This fake word has made its way into some
                    dictionaries, but the proper phrase is <span class="italic">all right</span>.</p>
                <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="bolditalic">Conversate</span></p>
                <p class="blockquote-n">The verb form of <span class="italic">conversation</span> is <span
                        class="italic">to converse</span>. People having a conversation are conversing. If you find
                    yourself saying or writing <span class="italic">conversate</span>, change it to <span
                        class="italic">converse</span> instead.</p>

        <p class="noindent1">Commas are the most frequently used punctuation marks, as well as the ones that cause the
            greatest confusion. Learning a few rules can boost your comma confidence.</p>
        <h3 class="h3">Use a Comma When Joining Two Full Setences with <span class="italic">and, or, but, so,
                nor,</span> or <span class="italic">for</span></h3>
        <p class="blockquote-1"><span class="italic">The flight was delayed, and they spent the night in a hotel.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="blockquote-1"><span class="italic">Jennifer worked for the agency, but I never knew her there.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="blockquote-1"><span class="italic">Almost everyone is here, so I think we should get started.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="blockquote-1"><span class="italic">They have not upgraded this year, nor do they expect to upgrade
                next year.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote-1"><span class="italic">Opening another plant in France was impossible, for the costs were
                too high.</span></p>
        <h3 class="h3">Use a Comma Between Items in a Series (Note that These Items Can Be Single Words or Phrases)</h3>
        <p class="blockquote-1"><span class="italic">The movers packed up the books, dishes, and artwork.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote-1"><span class="italic">On Saturday we do the laundry, mow the lawn, and wash the
                car.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote-1"><span class="italic">She enjoys playing the violin, working in the garden, and trading
                stock options.</span></p>
        <p class="noindent1">Note: In these examples, the comma before the &#8220;and&#8221; is optional. Known as a
            &#8220;serial comma&#8221; or &#8220;Oxford comma,&#8221; it is not required, but it can improve the clarity
            of a sentence.</p>
        <h3 class="h3">Use a Comma After a Long Introductory Phrase or Clause.</h3>
        <p class="blockquote-1"><span class="italic">With the surgery behind him, Tim was able to travel to Italy
                comfortably.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote-1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_220"></span><span class="italic">Because of the
                shortage of housing in the city, they moved to the suburbs.</span></p>
        <h3 class="h3">Use a Comma After an Introductory Adverb That Modifies the Entire Sentence.</h3>
        <p class="blockquote-1"><span class="italic">Unfortunately, the guacamole was gone when they arrived.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote-1"><span class="italic">Alternatively, we could take the train into the city.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote-1"><span class="italic">On the other hand, it might be better to work on the taxes in the
                morning.</span></p>
        <h3 class="h3">Use a Comma to Set Off a Nonrestrictive Modifier or Appositive.</h3>
        <p class="noindent">(An <span class="italic">appositive</span> is a noun or a pronoun set next to another to
            explain or identify it. A <span class="italic">nonrestrictive</span> element is not essential to the meaning
            of a sentence. If it&#8217;s deleted, the sentence still makes sense and retains its meaning.)</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">The car, a black Lexus, was parked in the underground
                garage.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote-1"><span class="italic">The sweater, which was too small already, shrank in the
                wash.</span></p>
        <h3 class="h3">Use a Comma to Set Off Sentence Modifiers and Sentence Elements Out of the Normal Word Order.
        </h3>
        <p class="blockquote-1"><span class="italic">The new software, unfortunately, is even harder to use than the old
                version.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote-1"><span class="italic">Urban living, I think, will become the norm soon.</span></p>
        <p class="noindent1">Note: Although it&#8217;s tempting to insert a comma wherever you might pause in speech,
            you&#8217;re far safer to follow the rules above than to punctuate &#8220;by ear.&#8221;</p>

        <p class="noindent1">Colons and semicolons frequently cause confusion, but they are very easy to master. The few
            rules explained here will equip you to use colons and semicolons correctly.</p>
        <h3 class="h3">Colons Are Used to <span class="italic">Introduce</span></h3>
        <p class="noindent">Use a colon to introduce a list of things:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">He bought all the ingredients for the recipe: pasta, tomato
                sauce, fresh tomatoes, and cheese.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">You can use a colon to introduce an entire sentence, if the second part explains the first.
        </p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">The renovation was extensive: they replaced all the electrical
                and plumbing systems in the building.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">Think of a colon as saying &#8220;the following&#8221; or &#8220;in other words.&#8221;</p>
        <h3 class="h3">Semicolons Are Used to Separate</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Use a semicolon when joining two full sentences <span class="italic">without</span> a
            conjunction like <span class="italic">and, or, but, nor,</span> or <span class="italic">for.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">Tony took the train home; Paul had a car.</span></p>

                Dashes</a></h2>
        <p class="noindent1">Many people use dashes, parentheses, and brackets interchangeably; however, each of these
            punctuation marks has its own correct usage. These guidelines will help you understand and use them
            correctly.</p>
        <h3 class="h3">Parentheses</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Use parentheses to enclose a loosely related comment, explanation, or elaboration within a
            sentence or a paragraph. You should be able to omit the material within the parentheses without changing the
            basic meaning or structure of the sentence or paragraph.</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">We saw a production of</span> Titus Andronicus <span
                class="italic">(one of Shakespeare&#8217;s earliest plays) in London.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic">The cook (it was his first day on the job) used the wrong sauce for
                the enchiladas.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic">Al worked for the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in
                Washington, D.C.</span></p>
        <p class="noindent1">Note: A parenthetical sentence within another sentence has no initial capital letter or
            period.</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">At that point all flights were canceled. (The rain had gotten
                much heavier.) We had no choice but to wait.</span></p>
        <p class="noindent1">Note: A freestanding parenthetical sentence requires an initial capital letter and a period
            inside the parentheses.</p>
        <h3 class="h3"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_223"></span>Brackets</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Use brackets to indicate that you have inserted something into a quotation to clarify the
            meaning.</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">Deb said during her acceptance speech, &#8220;I am honored by it
                [the award], but I could not have achieved this without the help of my staff.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p class="noindent1">You can also use brackets to set off an interpolation <span class="italic">within</span>
            parentheses.</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">By a vote of 5&#8211;4, the Supreme Court overturned the lower
                court&#8217;s ruling. (See <a target="_blank" href="15_Chapter06.xhtml#page_153">here</a> [Figure A] for
                a chronology of the case.)</span></p>
        <h3 class="h3">Dashes</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Use dashes to indicate a break in thought.</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">The truth is&#8212;and you probably already know it&#8212;that
                we can&#8217;t manage without you.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote"><span class="italic">I think we can go ahead and accept&#8212;no, we can&#8217;t!</span>
        </p>
        <p class="noindent1">You can also use a dash to introduce a summary or explanation.</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">It was a close call&#8212;the sudden wind almost overturned the
                boat.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic">Legislators were in a tough position&#8212;they had to fund the
                program without raising taxes.</span></p>

        <p class="noindent1">Capitalization often seems arbitrary, probably because so many people use capitals
            incorrectly. Everyone knows to capitalize the first letter of a sentence and people&#8217;s names; the
            following few rules will help you capitalize correctly every time.</p>
        <h3 class="h3"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_224"></span>Capitalize All the Words in Place-Names</h3>
        <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic">Silver Lake, Park Avenue, Atlantic Ocean, Appalachian Mountains,
                Pacific Coast Highway, Atwater Village, New York City</span></p>
        <h3 class="h3">Capitalize Recognized Sections of the World or the Country</h3>
        <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic">the South, the Sunset Strip, the Northwest, the Lake District, the
                Far East</span></p>
        <h3 class="h3">Don’t Capitalize <span class="italic">East, West, North, or South</span> When They Indicate
            Direction; Do Capitalize Them When They Refer to Recognized Sections of a Country </h3>
        <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic">Go west on Colorado Boulevard till you hit the freeway.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic">Just east of the house, there&#8217;s a stand of eucalyptus

        <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic">the Midwest, the West Coast, the Southeast, the Northeast, the West
                Country</span></p>

        <h3 class="h3">Capitalize the Titles of Books, Stories, Poems, Songs, Movies, and Other Words of Art </h3>
        <p class="hang1-no">The Hobbit, The Red Badge of Courage, The Big Sleep, Paradise Lost, <span

        <h3 class="h3">What Not to Capitalize</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Do not capitalize a word just because the concept seems important to you (a really annoying
            habit known among editors as Very Important Thing syndrome).</p>
        <h2 class="h2" id="sec75"><a class="none" href="06_Contents.xhtml#rsec75">How to Use Quotation Marks</a></h2>
        <p class="noindent1">Quotation marks are used to set off words in a sentence. Most frequently, they indicate a
            direct quotation from someone other than the writer. Quotation marks are frequently misused, but if you
            learn these few rules you&#8217;ll never go wrong.</p>
        <h3 class="h3">Double Quotations Marks</h3>
        <p class="noindent">In American usage, you&#8217;ll need double quotation marks, not single ones, most of the
            time. You&#8217;ll need to use single quotation marks if you have a quotation within a quotation.</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">Penelope told us what happened in the meeting: &#8220;Marc and
                Jen both said, &#8216;This is a really terrible idea&#8217; at the same time.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p class="noindent1">Use quotation marks to set off the exact words of a speaker or writer.</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_226"></span><span class="italic">Gail read the
                message and blurted out, &#8220;That&#8217;s ridiculous.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic">The sign over the door said, &#8220;No bicycles or
                skateboards.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p class="noindent1">Use quotation marks for the titles of articles, essays, poems, chapters, and songs. (Titles
            of books, magazines, and newspapers belong in italics. Here, because the example sentences are set in
            italics, those titles reverse out to roman.)</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">His song &#8220;Let&#8217;s Call the Whole Thing Off&#8221;
                appeared in the 1937 movie</span> Shall We Dance<span class="italic">.</span></p>
        <p class="blockquote-n"><span class="italic">Her essay &#8220;Shakespeare&#8217;s Language&#8221; was reprinted
                in the book</span> Renaissance Literary Rhetoric<span class="italic">.</span></p>
        <p class="noindent1">Use quotation marks to indicate the ironic use of a word.</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">One of the &#8220;advantages&#8221; the broker mentioned was the
                apartment&#8217;s proximity to a punk rock club.</span></p>
        <p class="noindent1">Use quotation marks to refer to a word being used as the word itself.</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">The word &#8220;pizza&#8221; first appeared in a Latin text in
                the year 997.</span></p>
        <p class="noindent1">Don&#8217;t use quotation marks to add emphasis. Use italics, boldface, or underlining
            instead, and do so only sparingly.</p>
        <p class="noindent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_227"></span>Not like this:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">Food is &#8220;not&#8221; permitted in the theater.</span></p>

        <p class="blockquote1-n-j"><span class="italic">Absolutely no parking during business hours.</span></p>
        <h3 class="h3">Punctuation with Quotation Marks</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Commas and periods go <span class="italic">inside</span> the quotation marks.<sup><a

                be done with this project by Friday.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p class="noindent1">Exclamation points and question marks go inside the quotation marks when they are part of
            the quotation.</p>
