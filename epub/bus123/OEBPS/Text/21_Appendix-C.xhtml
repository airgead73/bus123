</div>
    </div>      

 
<p class="tx">Job searching can be a job in itself. It takes spending time, undertaking market and company research, organizing the information you find, preparing résumés and cover letters, going on job interviews, writing thank-you letters for those interviews, and then repeating the process—often many times—before you are hired. This appendix is intended to remind you of some best practices when searching for a career and the numerous resources you have at your disposal.</p>  

<p class="tx">One of the most valuable (and free) resources you, as an Ashford student and, later, an alumnus, have access to is My Career. There, you can access a wealth of information and obtain one-on-one help from a Career Advisor by e-mail or phone. My Career contains resources that include a résumé builder, résumé templates, mock interview modules, and individualized career pathways based on your degree program. The site also includes resources for career exploration, self-assessment, and job searches, as well as special resources for military students. Log on to My Career through either your Student Portal or the <span class="hyperlink"><a  target="_blank" href="https://ashford.instructure.com/courses/62986">Student Support Center</a></span> in your online classroom.</p>

<p class="tx">Don’t be discouraged if the ideal job does not come along as quickly as you hope. Always remember that career management is an important competency that you should work to develop—career management doesn’t end when you secure your first job after graduation. Other important competencies include oral/written communication and professionalism/work ethic. Each time you apply for a job, optimize your résumé, or craft a cover letter, you are demonstrating your mastery of these competencies, which, in turn, increases your ability to secure an ideal position.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Job Searching</h2>
<p class="tx">You should always research a company before you apply to work there—this will help you learn as much as you can about the organization. The company’s website is one of your best sources of information. Through My Career, Ashford students also have premium access to Vault.com. Vault is a fantastic resource for researching companies, industries, and job market trends. General job and career websites and job boards can be useful resources as well. The following table describes and evaluates some of the most popular job boards. Just keep in mind that not all jobs will be listed on job boards.</p>

<p class="tx">It’s important to remember that although the digital world makes it easy to submit applications for jobs online, you will have far better success getting your foot in the door through networking than by applying randomly for jobs you find on the web. While simply responding to job postings can work, it is often like cold calling or telemarketing. Sometimes you can have success, but you will probably encounter more rejection than you will if someone who knows you introduces you to a potential employer or puts in a good word for you with a company where he or she currently works.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Networking</h2> 

<p class="tx">"Networking is the process whereby you get connected to and build relationships with people who can help advance your career" (Hansen, 2008, p. 7).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" id="fn-22" href="21_Appendix-C.xhtml#fn_22">&#8727;</a></sup><i> In A Foot in the Door: Networking Your Way into a Hidden Job Market,</i> Hansen divides networking into two basic types: developmental and strategic. Developmental networking occurs as you make connections with people you know from various social, work, recreational, and service aspects of your life. Developmental networking grows as people get to know you as a responsible, dependable individual who fulfills commitments and is working toward specific goals. This type of networking occurs as the result of social contacts and organizational affiliations.</p>

<p class="tx">Strategic networking is networking with a purpose: finding and securing employment that allows entry into and progression within a specific career. Friends, family, course instructors, former employers, internship supervisors and coworkers, and the people you have interviewed or shadowed form the basis of your strategic network. This type of intentional networking takes time. It is never too soon to begin to make connections with people you have met through professional organizations or those currently employed in the companies you have targeted for possible employment.</p>

<p class="tx">Of course, not everyone you meet has the hiring power to advance your career, but often your contacts can be an intermediate link to valuable information and career advice while steering you toward opportunities to meet the people who actually do the hiring. The number one rule of networking is never to overlook the role of well-networked intermediaries. They can provide the word-of-mouth recommendation that results in your résumé receiving a second look or your application a positive review. The number two rule is closely related to the first: you are more likely to be hired if you are referred by a mutual acquaintance than if you submit the application or résumé "cold" (Hansen, 2008, p. 9).</p>

<p class="tx">Networking with other peers and professionals is one of the best ways to hear about job openings before they are posted on job boards. Finding a suitable position generally requires more than applying for a job online. If you want to get noticed and learn about opportunities before they are ever posted online, you have to network. While it may seem daunting, it is likely something you do every day without even realizing it. For example, getting to know your instructors and fellow classmates helps you build your professional network.</p>

<p class="tx">Networking shouldn’t end when you find a suitable position. Building professional relationships affects your career trajectory, supports your collaborations with other professionals in your field, and can help you develop key insights or expertise. Think of networking as just that—relationship-building. Look for industry-specific meetups in your region, join a student organization, or become a member of a professional organization or society. These are all ways to expand and enrich your personal network.</p>

<h3 class="h3">On Social Media</h3>

<p class="tx">Social and professional networking websites can be excellent ways to connect with people who are working in fields you would like to enter or who know people you might contact for more information or professional opportunities in a specific field. By networking on LinkedIn, for example, you can find out who is hiring and get leads from other people in their network. The website includes professionals who want to find clients who might use their skills and job hunters who are looking for employment. Recruiters who are responsible for hiring people at their companies also use LinkedIn to find potential employees.</p>

<p class="tx">To use LinkedIn, you must create an account on the website and make a public profile to use the job search features. The networking features are easy to use and allow you to connect directly with other members. LinkedIn has become an active and popular space to form specific networks for yourself, such as joining a network of other Ashford students or one based on your job interests or experiences. It is also a useful place to learn about various professions and job opportunities. You can learn how to create a strong profile and get the most out of your account at the following links: </p>

<p class="tx">Remember to visit all social media sites and blogs with the eye of an employer to ensure that you present as a professional.</p>


<p class="listb"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images"/><span class="space"/>Thoughtfully edit the photos and comments posted on your social media sites that you would never want a potential employer to read.</p>
<p class="listb"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images"/><span class="space"/>Be sure to monitor your social media sites regularly to guard against one of your friends posting an inappropriate comment or photo.</p>
<p class="listb"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images"/><span class="space"/>Periodically search for your name online via one of the major search engines. If you find something that may be harmful to your reputation, you can request that the content be removed. Google, for instance, has links to guide you through the process. If it is on a friend's social media page, try contacting the friend to have it removed or hidden.</p>


<h3 class="h3">At Job Fairs</h3>

<p class="tx">Don’t forget, too, to check out job fairs or career fairs for networking opportunities. Throughout the country, such fairs are held regularly (usually at no charge) by large companies, groups of employers, local communities, government agencies, school districts, and other organizations to find qualified job candidates. These events usually last for a few hours or half a day at a specific location. Because different employers are often present, you usually will not be able to customize your résumé to a specific organization. However, if you wish, you will have the chance to meet a number of different company representatives, chat with them briefly, and hand them a copy of a general résumé you have prepared.</p>

<p class="tx">To participate in these job or career fairs, search using the keywords “job fair” or “career fair” and the name of your local community or state for calendars of nearby events. You can also check out one of the following job fair websites:</p>

<p class="tx">Prior to an event, prepare a standard résumé and make multiple copies. On the day of the fair, dress professionally, arrive early, and carry some type of folder that contains your résumés. Stop by any tables of companies that interest you to learn more about them, network with people in the industry, and decide if you would like to leave a résumé for their review. Ask about when they might get back to you or if you can follow up later—and then do so!</p>

<h2 class="h2">Informational Interviewing</h2>

<p class="tx">An informational interview (sometimes called a &quot;career conversation&quot;) allows you to talk with a person who is currently employed in a job in your field of interest. It provides an opportunity to gather information about a career from a real insider. By meeting with someone who has first-hand experience, you become more fully aware of the daily responsibilities and challenges of the job, and you gain perspective about the realities of the career from someone who is living it. People who request informational interviews want knowledge and information about real-life experiences beyond what they have read in a book or heard about from a career counselor. The informational interview allows you to determine whether a specific career might be a good fit for you.</p>

<p class="tx">Finding the right person for the informational interview is key. Contact family members, friends, friends of friends, or individuals you have read about in local business news publications to help you identify the best candidate for the interview. If you are enrolled in courses, communicate with your instructors in order to gain their expertise and input. Ask if they know of someone you could reach out to. Keep your interactions professional; the contacts you make during this process help lay the groundwork for future employment, as you'll be building a network of people who know that you are actively seeking a career in a specific area.</p>

<p class="tx">Once you have secured names, request appointments with these people, clarifying with each that the purpose is to conduct an informational interview. Once the appointments are scheduled, begin to gather information about the role each of your interviewees plays within his or her organization, as well as information about the organization for which each works. The informational interviews can provide you with "dress rehearsals" for actual job interviews: you must dress and act the part of a professional job seeker, and for both, you must do your homework to learn about the field, the organization, and the specific job position.</p>
