<p class="noindent"><span class="big">The aim of this book</span> is to help you get all of your writing done faster and to build your confidence and skills as a business writer. In the pages that follow, you&#8217;ll find:</p>
<p class="list1"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images"/><span class="space"/>A <span class="bold">seven-step method</span> you can use with all kinds of business writing</p>
<p class="indent1">You can apply these seven steps to anything you write at work, and you can do so <span class="italic">quickly</span>. You&#8217;ll find before and after examples of what happens when you apply the step to a sample piece of writing. I&#8217;ve put the steps together in a checklist you can use as you write at work.</p>
<p class="indent">You&#8217;ll notice that you&#8217;re already good at some of these steps and less good at others. Feel free to spend as much or as little time with each step as you like. The last thing I want is for you to have to read the whole book to learn a system. Instead, the book is designed for you to pick it up and find helpful tips you can use right away.</p>
<p class="list1"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images"/><span class="space"/>Guidance on the <span class="bold">most popular types of business writing</span>, including e-mails, instant messages, and PowerPoint presentations</p>
<p class="indent1">You&#8217;ll find detailed advice on how to write these successfully, as well as special tips on how to implement the seven steps in the various kinds of documents you write.</p>
<p class="list1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_2"></span><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images"/><span class="space"/>Easy-to-use <span class="bold">resources</span> on writing skills, style, grammar, and punctuation</p>
<p class="indent1">Are you looking for a remedy for writer&#8217;s block? Don&#8217;t remember exactly when to use a comma? Can&#8217;t recall what the heck a semicolon is for? Always confusing &#8220;affect&#8221; and &#8220;effect&#8221;? You&#8217;ll get this information and more in the &#8220;Resources&#8221; chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">You&#8217;ll also find brief sections to help you with things like tone, structure, formatting, and writing for mobile devices.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, you&#8217;ll find sidebars written by a group of experts in various fields, offering their insights and tried-and-true methods for writing successfully in business.</p>
<p class="indent">Throughout the book, the emphasis is on practical application in a real business setting. It&#8217;s my hope that this book will answer your questions, clear some blocks, and get you writing quickly and efficiently at work.</p>

The section on writing at school covers the basics of note taking and bibliographies, the compare/contrast essay, lab reports, and school newspaper articles. It also offers tips on written communications for the academic environment, such as e-mails requesting a recommendation from a teacher or professor.</p>
