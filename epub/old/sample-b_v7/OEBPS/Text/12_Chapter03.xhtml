        <p class="noindent2"><span class="big">In this section,</span> we&#8217;ll explore a seven-step process that you
            can use to write anything you need to write. You&#8217;ve probably seen lists like the one <a
                target="_blank" href="12_Chapter03.xhtml#page_10">here</a> before. There are lots of sensible ways to
            organize and describe the writing process. This one is distilled from my thirty years of work as a writing
            coach and trainer, and I think it&#8217;s comprehensive. If you follow it, you&#8217;ll get your writing
            done. Feel free to adapt it and tailor it to your own needs.</p>
        <p class="indent">As you browse through these steps, you&#8217;ll see that they work together; once you get the
            hang of one, you&#8217;ll probably find yourself unconsciously addressing the others. For example, once you
            have clarity on Step 1, <span class="italic">Get the ask clear</span>, you might find that your openings
            automatically get <span class="italic">stronger and more specific</span> (Step 3). When you really think
            about <span class="italic">writing for your reader</span> (Step 2), you&#8217;ll choose your <span
                class="italic">content</span> in a more targeted way (Step 5).</p>
        <p class="indent">The ultimate point of this process is not to train you to follow a step-by-step process
            slavishly for the rest of your life, but to make you a better and faster writer. Working with the steps is a
            means to that end. You should feel free to use the steps any way you want. You can try working with them in
            numerical order, or you can browse around and pick up tips here and there. Keep what&#8217;s useful to you;
            discard what isn&#8217;t. Using the steps will help you refine your own writing process and become a
            stronger and more confident writer.</p>

        <p class="epia"><span class="italic">&#8220;If you want me to respond to your e-mail, you HAVE to let me know
                exactly what you want, and you have to do it fast. I don&#8217;t have time to guess what I&#8217;m
                supposed to do.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p class="epi-r">&#8212;S<span class="small">URVEY RESPONDENT</span></p>
        <p class="noindent2">Whenever you write, you&#8217;re asking for something from your reader. It might be a
            direct request&#8212;&#8220;please do this,&#8221; &#8220;please send me that.&#8221; It might also be a
            simple request for the reader&#8217;s attention, in which case the ask is really &#8220;please read this
            information and take it in.&#8221;</p>
        <p class="indent">The ask might be quick, or it might be extended over many pages; one sort of longer ask is a
            business plan, where the entire document is an argument in support of the request &#8220;please invest money
            in our venture.&#8221; It might be an initial e-mail intended to open a &#173;discussion&#8212;for instance,
            about changing procedures or hiring a new staff member.</p>
        <p class="indent">The ask also might be an <span class="italic">implicit</span> ask, as when a company publishes
            a white paper on research it has conducted or a process it has developed. The white paper doesn&#8217;t
            explicitly request that the reader hire the firm, but if it&#8217;s well done it appeals to a need the
            reader has and piques his interest in learning more. In business, there&#8217;s an implicit ask embedded in
            most knowledge sharing and thought leadership.</p>
        <p class="indent">Whether you&#8217;re asking your reader to take action now, to start thinking about taking
            action in the future, or just to pay attention, your communication will be more effective if she understands
            why you&#8217;re writing&#8212;if you can <span class="bold">get the ask clear</span>.</p>
        <p class="indent">Getting the ask clear depends on getting clarity in your own mind about what you really want
            from the reader. Getting the ask clear in your own head isn&#8217;t always as easy as it sounds. How many
            times have you read one of those meandering e-mails and wondered, &#8220;<span class="italic">What</span>
            exactly do you want from me?&#8221; Maybe you&#8217;ve even reread one of your <span epub:type="pagebreak"
                id="page_12"></span>own e-mails after you&#8217;ve sent it and cringed a little bit at how unclear it
            seems in retrospect.</p>
        <p class="indent">Just for a moment, entertain the idea that you&#8217;re not entirely sure what you want, or at
            least you&#8217;re not as clear as you ought to be. It happens more often than you think.</p>
        <p class="indent">Let&#8217;s take a look at a couple of examples.</p>
        <p class="indent">Luc&#8217;s company is getting ready to sign a three-year contract with <span
                class="small">SARCO</span>. The evening after the team&#8217;s most recent call with <span
                class="small">SARCO</span>, some things are bothering Luc, so he sends this e-mail to his team:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1">I have concerns about the latest draft of the contract with <span
                class="small">SARCO</span>. We talked about this on the call, but I&#8217;m still not sure what the
            sign-off process is. And the requirements for Year 3 are vague&#8212;if they want something different from
            what we&#8217;ve delivered in Years 1 and 2, it could potentially be costly or force us to renegotiate.
            We&#8217;re close to having a really good agreement, but I think we still have a few issues to address.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Luc</p>
        <p class="indent1">Luc flags his areas of concern clearly, but his e-mail sounds more like he&#8217;s turning
            over some thoughts in his head than actually making a suggestion. What does Luc want from his readers? Does
            he know at this point?</p>
        <p class="indent">Now suppose Luc looks at this first draft, thinks about what he&#8217;s really asking, and
            does some revising.</p>
        <p class="blockquote1">I think we&#8217;re close to a really good agreement with <span
                class="small">SARCO</span>. But I suggest we hold off finalizing the contract until we clarify these two
            questions:</p>
        <p class="list2"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />What exactly is the
            sign-off process? (We tried but didn&#8217;t resolve it on the call.)</p>
        <p class="listaa"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />What are the requirements
            for Year 3?</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind-t"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_13"></span>If we don&#8217;t straighten these
            out now, it could be costly in the future. Let&#8217;s put these on the agenda for the next call and push to
            get resolution.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Luc</p>
        <p class="indent1">The content of the two e-mails is nearly the same, but in the second draft Luc has taken a
            moment to clarify in his own mind exactly why he&#8217;s sending the message: he wants to hold off on
            signing the contract and continue discussions with <span class="small">SARCO</span> until the two open
            issues are clarified. The team knows where he stands, he&#8217;s made a concrete suggestion, and now
            everyone can get to a resolution faster.</p>
        <p class="indent">Of course there are situations where you might not want to be as direct as Luc has been in his
            second draft, maybe for political reasons. If you&#8217;re going to propose something you know will be
            unpopular, for instance, you might choose to be less direct and soften your message a bit. Whether you
            choose to be direct or indirect in your communication, you should do it by choice, not by accident.</p>
        <p class="indent">We&#8217;re often in such a rush that we fire off e-mails without much thought&#8212;we think
            they&#8217;re clear, but are they? If your ask isn&#8217;t clear in your own mind, your chances of
            expressing it clearly are slim. You&#8217;re likely to wander, let your focus drift, and lose your
            reader&#8217;s attention.</p>
        <p class="indent">A lot of our communications at work are less high-stakes than Luc&#8217;s e-mail. Many are
            simply about conveying information. But even if the stakes aren&#8217;t particularly high, you&#8217;d like
            your reader to actually <span class="italic">read</span> your message, and getting your ask clear can help
            make that happen.</p>
        <p class="indent">Let&#8217;s look at a second example of getting the ask clear. In this case, Harshita is
            writing to her boss, Lyn, to share information about a workshop she thinks might be useful for their team.
        </p>
        <p class="blockquotea">Hi Lyn,</p>
        <p class="blockquote">I had lunch yesterday with Len Cohen. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve heard of him, but
            he was the company&#8217;s director of visual <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_14"></span>communications
            for over twenty years, and he&#8217;s still giving workshops in visual design, using charts, and creating
            effective presentations. I&#8217;m attaching some of the materials he sent me. I&#8217;d love to chat with
            you about his workshops one of these days.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Thanks,</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Harshita</p>
        <p class="indent1">Do you think Lyn is going to open those attachments? I don&#8217;t. She might mean to, but
            she probably never will. Harshita fired off this e-mail in a hurry, without thinking of the outcome she
            wanted. If Harshita really wants Lyn to look at the information, she&#8217;ll craft a message with that
            purpose in mind:</p>
        <p class="blockquotea">Hi Lyn,</p>
        <p class="blockquote">I had lunch yesterday with Len Cohen. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve heard of him, but
            he was the company&#8217;s director of visual communications for over twenty years, and he&#8217;s still
            giving workshops in visual design, using charts, and creating effective presentations. I&#8217;m attaching
            some of the materials he sent me. I think the Communicating Through Presentations workshop could be really
            helpful for us. Let&#8217;s talk.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Thanks,</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Harshita</p>
        <p class="indent1">This version is likely to pique Lyn&#8217;s interest, and she&#8217;ll be more liable to look
            at the information. Now let&#8217;s take it a step further and imagine that Harshita thinks it would be a
            really great idea for the team to take one of these workshops. So her ask has changed from simply sharing
            information to trying to convince Lyn to consider booking the workshop. (Note that I said convince her to
            <span class="italic">consider</span>. It&#8217;s too early to convince her to <span class="italic">say
                yes</span>. The more precisely you understand the ask for each communication, the better your chance of
            communicating effectively.)</p>
        <p class="blockquotea"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_15"></span>Hi Lyn,</p>
        <p class="blockquote">What would you think about getting the team some training in presenting? I&#8217;m
            attaching information about a workshop I think the team could benefit from, and I&#8217;d love to talk with
            you about it.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">I had lunch yesterday with Len Cohen. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve heard of him,
            but he was the company&#8217;s director of visual communications for over twenty years, and he&#8217;s still
            giving workshops in visual design, using charts, and creating effective presentations.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">I think his Communicating Through Presentations workshop would be great for us. A lot
            of our team hasn&#8217;t come up through the sales organization, so they didn&#8217;t get the kind of
            grounding that others have (this includes me). I think it would be especially helpful for our sales team.
            But as we grow, we want everyone to be comfortable presenting. Shall I block half an hour next week to talk
            about this?</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Thanks,</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Harshita</p>
        <p class="indent1">In this version, Harshita is clear in her mind what she wants to do: get Lyn interested in
            this material and begin a discussion about whether to hire Len. How does she do that? She opens the e-mail
            with a question for Lyn&#8212;Lyn now knows she&#8217;s supposed to make a decision about this topic rather
            than just read about it. Harshita uses a more engaged and enthusiastic tone. She also makes a clear
            recommendation (&#8220;I think his . . . workshop would be great for us&#8221;), coupled with support for
            that recommendation (pointing out that the team lacks this skill and that everyone needs to be able to
            present because the group is growing so fast).</p>
        <p class="indent">So you can see how taking a minute to clarify what you want and construct your message
            accordingly can result in very different &#173;messages&#8212;with potentially very different results.</p>
        <h2 class="h2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_16"></span>How to Get the Ask Clear</h2>
        <p class="noindent1">Most of us are short on time when we write at work, and we don&#8217;t have much
            opportunity to craft our messages. But it usually takes less than a minute to stop and think about what
            you&#8217;re asking from your readers and to write your message with that objective in mind. When you
            consider how much time you might waste waiting for a reply that doesn&#8217;t come or sorting out any
            confusion that might follow an unclear ask, it&#8217;s well worth spending that minute to clarify your
            purpose before you hit Send.</p>
        <p class="indent">If you&#8217;re a <span class="bold">planner</span> and like to organize your content before
            you write a draft, try this trick as you&#8217;re planning. Say to yourself:</p>
        <p class="hang1a"><span class="italic">I am writing because</span> <span class="us">_______</span><span
                class="italic">.</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">I want my reader to</span> <span class="us">_______</span><span
                class="italic">.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">Fill in those blanks as specifically as you can. Don&#8217;t do it
            &#173;thoughtlessly&#8212;imagine exactly what you want your reader to do in response to your message. It
            might sound like a silly exercise, but you&#8217;ll be amazed at how this little bit of clarity will stop
            you from writing long, vague, ineffective messages.</p>
        <p class="indent">If you&#8217;re the type who likes to <span class="bold">edit</span>, and you already have a
            draft complete, stop before you send it off. Ask yourself:</p>
        <p class="hang1a"><span class="italic">What is my purpose in writing this?</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">What do I want from my reader?</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">If you can&#8217;t answer these questions, or if your answers seem vague, take a minute and
            think it through. Then try to put yourself in your reader&#8217;s shoes, and ask:</p>
        <p class="hang1a"><span class="italic">Will my purpose be clear to my reader?</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">If the answer is no, take some time to rework what you&#8217;ve written. This process often
            involves rewriting the beginning of the document to orient your reader <span epub:type="pagebreak"
                id="page_17"></span>(we&#8217;ll look more at beginnings in Step 3, <span class="italic">Start strong
                and specific</span>), cutting down the content, and doing some reorganizing to present your ideas in a
            structured way.</p>
        <h2 class="h2"><span class="bold">SUMMARY: Get the Ask Clear</span></h2>
        <p class="listb1"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />Think for a moment before
            you start to write or before you finalize. Ask yourself, &#8220;What outcome do I want from this? What do I
            want my reader to do?&#8221;</p>
        <p class="listb"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />Then ask yourself,
            &#8220;Have I really made it clear what I want my reader to do?&#8221;</p>

                <p class="noindent1s-n">If you&#8217;re working on a document or message that&#8217;s important to you,
                    consider asking for help. Find a colleague you trust, and ask him to read over your draft and share
                    his impressions of how it&#8217;s working. Having a second set of eyes on your draft can help you
                    see what you might be missing. Whenever you ask a colleague to read a draft, make sure you direct
                    his attention to areas where you want help: Is it persuasive? Is it too long? Do I need to say more?
                    Is the tone okay? If you just plop the text in front of him, you&#8217;ll probably get feedback on
                    things that don&#8217;t matter to you. People <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_18"></span>want
                    to be helpful (and they want to sound smart), so you&#8217;ll get a more comprehensive review than
                    you need, and your colleague might even miss what you&#8217;re looking for. You&#8217;ll save your
                    colleague&#8217;s time as well as your own by asking specific questions about the draft. Don&#8217;t
                    forget to offer to return the favor. It&#8217;s great to have a trusted partner at work when you
                    need editing or even just a quick proofread.</p>

                <p class="noindent1s-n">Do you want to be a better writer and a better colleague? If you&#8217;re
                    writing about a problem and you&#8217;re not sure of the solution, don&#8217;t just speculate and

                    variables: the culture in your organization, your position, and the position of your reader, among
                    other things. Proposing a solution might mean making a strong argument for a particular course of
                    action, or it might mean sharing your opinion. Whatever course you choose, you&#8217;ll be giving
                    your readers something to respond to rather than just pointing out a problem and leaving it for
                    someone else to deal with. By proposing a solution, you help everyone get closer to solving the

                </h3>
                <h3 class="headb"><span class="italic">Joel Comm</span></h3>
                <p class="noindent1s-j">A lot of people are afraid to write, but not me. I&#8217;ll tell you why.
                    I&#8217;ve figured out how to write by not writing.</p>
                <p class="indents-j">I have a lot of projects I&#8217;m working on at the same time, including writing a
                    new book, and to be honest I find the process of writing books agonizing. It&#8217;s a huge task.
                    But I love telling stories, and I love talking about ideas. So I&#8217;ve found a way to harness
                    what I&#8217;m good at to get my writing done. I sit down with someone who asks really good
                    questions, and in answering those questions, I tell the stories and talk about the ideas I want to
                    include in my book. Once this process is done, I have the content transcribed and work with an
                    associate to make sense of it.</p>
                <p class="indents-j">This same technique can work for you, especially if you&#8217;re intimidated by the
                    act of writing. If you have something to write that&#8217;s making you nervous or something you
                    really don&#8217;t want to write, grab someone you trust in your office, and talk it through. Ask
                    them to ask you questions. Get the juices flowing. Stir up the conversation, and let it draw the
                    content out of you. Take notes if you want to, but don&#8217;t get so bogged down in the
                    note-&#173;taking that you fail to engage in the dialogue. If you&#8217;re going to take notes,
                    it&#8217;s better to jot down any especially good key phrases that pop out of your mouth rather than
                    try to write down every word. The idea is to keep your thought process flowing.</p>
                <p class="indents-j">Speaking rather than writing is a technique that executives used regularly years
                    ago, dictating letters and other documents into a Dictaphone or speaking while their secretaries
                    took notes in shorthand. They trusted their secretaries to transcribe accurately and to clean up any
                    grammatical errors that might have slipped out.</p>
                <p class="indents-j"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_20"></span>While most of us don&#8217;t have
                    assistants who take dictation, this technique is still something you can make a habit of. Find a
                    thinking/writing/telling partner at work, someone you trust, and help each other; listen and ask
                    good questions to support each other with writing tasks. You&#8217;ll find that you can get your
                    writing done more easily by avoiding writing.</p>

        <p class="epia"><span class="italic">&#8220;There are different kinds of writing for different audiences and
                different purposes&#8212;too often people forget the real audience and just write generically, as if

        <p class="epi-r">&#8212;S<span class="small">URVEY RESPONDENT</span></p>
        <p class="noindent1">Understanding and articulating what you want is only half of the communication formula. The
            other half, of course, is your reader. If your ask is clear, your reader should understand what you want him
            to do. Now it&#8217;s time to work on convincing him to do it. To do that, you have to <span
                class="bold">write for your reader</span>.</p>
        <p class="indent">It&#8217;s surprising how easy it is to forget about your reader. If you&#8217;re just firing
            off a short e-mail, your reader is probably at the top of your mind&#8212;e-mail is a lot like conversation
            that way. But the longer and more complex your document gets, the more likely you are to lose sight of your
            reader. You&#8217;re managing a lot of content, you&#8217;re probably in a rush, and it&#8217;s easy to get
            sucked into saying what you want to say instead of what the reader needs to hear, or trying to present
            comprehensive information, or presenting information just because you have it. Especially if you&#8217;ve
            been involved in researching or otherwise obtaining the information, the impulse is often to include more
            than your reader really needs.</p>
        <p class="indent">Whether you&#8217;re planning a document or editing a draft, it&#8217;s crucial for you to
            look at it from your reader&#8217;s point of view. Each reader has a unique point of view, and the better
            you understand that point of view, the more successful your communication will be. There are three factors
            you need to consider if you want to understand your reader&#8217;s point of view:</p>
        <p class="listb1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_22"></span><img src="../Images/common.jpg"
                alt="images" /><span class="space" /><span class="bold">Relationship.</span> What&#8217;s your
            relationship with your reader? Is your reader your boss, your client, your subordinate? Does your reader
            have to do as you ask, or do you have to convince him?</p>
        <p class="listb"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" /><span
                class="bold">Information</span>. How much information does your reader have about the topic you&#8217;re
            writing about? How much do you need to supply? How much information does your reader need to take the action
            you&#8217;d like her to take?</p>
        <p class="listb"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" /><span
                class="bold">Attitude</span>. What is your reader likely to think about your message? Will he be
            enthusiastic, cautious, hostile, indifferent? What expectations will he have? What&#8217;s in it for him?
        </p>
        <p class="indent1">These three factors are often intertwined, but thinking about them separately can help you
            understand the impact of each one. Let&#8217;s look at some examples of how each of these factors might
            affect the way you write.</p>
        <h2 class="h2">Relationship</h2>
        <p class="noindent1">Your relationship with your reader will shape the content you provide in your message and
            the way you provide it. Let&#8217;s look at an example.</p>
        <p class="indent">Mathias works for an IT consulting firm and is becoming worried that his client is withholding
            information from him. He&#8217;s writing to his boss, Cherie, and to his client contact, Rich, to try to
            solve the problem.</p>
        <p class="blockquotea">Hi Cherie,</p>
        <p class="blockquote">I&#8217;m running up against a problem with the sales group, particularly Rich. I think
            he&#8217;s withholding information about some transactions. I suspect the margin on some of their complex
            deals was not as good as it should have been. Oversight has been poor, so they&#8217;ve been able to keep
            this under wraps. We can&#8217;t complete the analysis unless we have complete information, and any
            recommendations we make will be skewed if we have bad data. I&#8217;ll follow up with Rich and keep you
            posted.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Mathias</p>
        <p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_23"></span>And here Mathias raises the same issue with
            his client contact, Rich:</p>
        <p class="blockquotea">Hi Rich,</p>
        <p class="blockquote">I was reviewing the data last night, and I&#8217;m having trouble tracking down a couple
            of deals. We want to look at all the transactions in aggregate, so I&#8217;m not worried about focusing on
            the details of any single transaction, but we do need to have data on all of them. Can you help me find the
            info on the Morton and Julu deals? Happy to jump on the phone if that would help.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Thanks,</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Mathias</p>
        <p class="indent1">Mathias has to walk a fine line here and address the needs of these two different readers.
            With his boss, Cherie, he can be blunt about what he suspects: that someone at the client is hiding data to
            protect himself. He also has to let her know what&#8217;s at risk from her point of view: that incomplete
            data can affect the results of their analysis and cause them to deliver inferior recommendations. With the
            client contact, Rich, Mathias has to raise the issue of the missing data in a nonthreatening way in order to
            get cooperation&#8212;he can&#8217;t force Rich to hand over the information. Mathias tells Rich that they
            are looking at the data in aggregate rather than studying the details of individual deals, which should
            reassure Rich that they will not be focusing on any mistakes he might have made.</p>
        <p class="indent">There&#8217;s no guarantee that Rich will cooperate, and there&#8217;s no way to reassure Rich
            that he won&#8217;t be held to account for any problems with his deals, but Mathias has done his best to
            anticipate Rich&#8217;s concerns and allay them.</p>
        <h2 class="h2">Information</h2>
        <p class="noindent1">Different readers need different kinds of information. Let&#8217;s look at a couple of
            examples.</p>
        <p class="indent">Jos&#233; works for Avalantra, a pharmaceutical company that&#8217;s developed <span
                epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_24"></span>a new extended-release formulation of the popular medication
            skeezazine, Skeezixx XR. His boss has asked him to draft scripts for two animated videos to be used on the
            company&#8217;s website: one for patients, which will be placed on the home page, and another for doctors,
            which will appear on a special password-protected page for providers on the site.</p>
        <p class="indent">Jos&#233; knows that these two audiences both need to be introduced to the new medication but
            that they&#8217;re going to require slightly different information because they have different needs and
            points of view. He tackles the version for doctors first:</p>
        <p class="blockquotea">New Skeezixx XR offers your skeezazine patients more options, with a $0 co-pay and a
            streamlined prescribing process. Skeezixx XR is the only 100% extended-release bead formulation of

            with the convenience of once-daily dosing. And Skeezixx XR is available in a broader range of dosage options
            than any other brand, with five available formulations&#8212;25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, and 200 mg.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">The Skeezixx XR <span class="bold">Quick Start Program</span> is designed to ensure
            that your patients have access to affordable Avalantra medications. The program can quickly identify

            through an e-voucher. Our agents can help patients locate pharmacies where the e-voucher is available.</p>

            help you get started immediately.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_25"></span>In addition, we offer personal

        <p class="blockquote-ind"><span class="bold">It&#8217;s never been so simple</span> to get the skeezazine
            formulation you need. Talk to your doctor about Skeezixx XR!</p>
        <p class="indent1">You can see that these different versions reflect the needs and interests of their respective
            audiences. Patients don&#8217;t need the detailed information about available dosages or all the ins and
            outs of the prescribing options that are essential for doctors. Patients do need to know that Avalantra is
            going to make the medication accessible to them.</p>

                <p class="headb"><span class="italic">Robert C. Daugherty</span></p>
                <p class="noindent1s-j">Today&#8217;s hottest companies&#8212;from Amazon to Apple to Google&#8212;have
                    at least one thing in common: they all started with a business plan. A business plan is a document
                    written for potential investors that outlines objectives and strategies; it is intended to convince
                    investors to put up cash for the new enterprise. The stakes are very high: you <span
                        class="italic">must</span> address your reader&#8217;s concerns, or you won&#8217;t get the
                    funding you need to start your business.</p>
                <p class="indents-j">To write a successful business plan, you have to provide persuasive answers to
                    three sets of questions. First are the people questions: Why are you the person to launch and run
                    this business? Are you known in the market? Can you attract the talent needed for success? Second
                    are the opportunity questions: Is the market for your product or service large and growing? Is there
                    a good fit between the product and the market? And third are the environment questions: What is the
                    context in which the venture is being launched? Are there competitors entering the market? How will
                    you respond when the market changes (and it will)? Your answers to these questions can mean the
                    difference between a successful, funded business and a lost opportunity. If you fail to answer them
                    adequately, your reader will simply say thanks, but no thanks.</p>
                <p class="indents-j"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_29"></span>Imagine if you took the same kind
                    of approach to your everyday business writing tasks, understanding that if you didn&#8217;t meet
                    your readers&#8217; expectations, you simply wouldn&#8217;t get what you were asking for. Imagine if
                    you asked yourself questions like &#8220;What does my reader care about?&#8221; and &#8220;How can I
                    supply what my reader needs?&#8221; and &#8220;How can I convince my reader?&#8221; every time you
                    wrote an important message. Obviously, most situations at work don&#8217;t have such high stakes,
                    but the practice of writing a business plan imposes a discipline that&#8217;s useful for all kinds
                    of business writing. Focus on your everyday business writing with the same kind of attention and
                    intensity entrepreneurs use in crafting a business plan, and you&#8217;ll increase your success rate
                    with all your business communications.</p>

        <h2 class="h2">Attitude</h2>
        <p class="noindent1">Sarah works for a small retailer whose website has expanded dramatically over the past few
            years. The website began as a supplement to the company&#8217;s print catalog years ago, and now it&#8217;s
            the primary sales channel. Sarah wants her boss, Mary, to provide some help for the team maintaining the
            website content.</p>
        <p class="blockquotea">Hi Mary,</p>
        <p class="blockquote">We really need help with the website. We can&#8217;t keep up with the volume of changes to
            the product descriptions on the site. Initially it made sense to have the marketing assistant maintain
            these. But since we&#8217;ve expanded so much, I think it&#8217;s time to take another look.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Jamie is swamped. In addition, we have so many different <span epub:type="pagebreak"
                id="page_30"></span>product categories now that we don&#8217;t have a consistent template for them or a
            consistent voice. There&#8217;s information missing from product descriptions, and Jamie is having to deal
            with the phone inquiries that come in.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">I think we should consider bringing in a contractor for the specific purpose of
            cleaning up all the product descriptions and posting new ones as we go forward. We could probably use a
            person full-time to take care of the site and the product descriptions, but as a first step we could bring
            in a contractor. Jamie and I could create a template and try to round up the missing content as the
            contractor identifies it.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Do you have time to talk about this next week?</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Thanks,</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Sarah</p>
        <p class="indent1">Sarah is understandably frustrated by the situation. It sounds like Jamie&#8217;s job has
            grown, and he needs some help. If you look at Sarah&#8217;s attitude in this draft, she&#8217;s focused
            almost exclusively on what she needs, and she hasn&#8217;t taken into account what Mary&#8217;s attitude
            might be.</p>
        <p class="indent">What might Mary think about Sarah&#8217;s message? First, it&#8217;s going to cost her money
            to hire a contractor. Even more alarmingly to anyone who has to manage a budget, Sarah&#8217;s talking about
            hiring another full-time permanent employee. Sarah&#8217;s message leaves some important questions
            unanswered. Sarah says Jamie is swamped, but why? And if Sarah and Jamie have the time to create a template
            and find the new content, why can&#8217;t they handle updating the descriptions? If I were Mary, my first
            response would be &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
        <p class="indent">Sarah hasn&#8217;t thought about this likely response, because she hasn&#8217;t fully
            considered what Mary&#8217;s attitude toward the idea might be. She&#8217;s thought only of what she and her
            team need. Now let&#8217;s say she&#8217;s taken some time to consider her reader in addition to her ask,
            and she&#8217;s going to write for her reader.</p>
        <p class="blockquotea"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_31"></span>Hi Mary,</p>
        <p class="blockquote">Can we set aside some time next week to talk about managing the website? We&#8217;ve
            expanded so much that the job has outgrown the way we initially conceived it, and I think bringing in a
            part-time contractor might meet our needs without being too expensive.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">We&#8217;re having the following problems:</p>
        <p class="list-1"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />Product descriptions on
            the site aren&#8217;t consistent, especially across categories.</p>
        <p class="lists"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />These inconsistent product
            descriptions result in an inconsistent voice online, so we&#8217;re not really implementing the branding
            work we did last year.</p>
        <p class="lists"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />There&#8217;s content
            missing in a lot of product descriptions, and Jamie is spending a lot of time fielding phone inquiries.</p>
        <p class="lists"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />Inconsistent and
            incomplete product descriptions make for a poor online experience for customers.</p>
        <p class="lists"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />Jamie is spending his time
            playing catch-up rather than advancing our marketing. He&#8217;s smart and has good ideas, and we
            didn&#8217;t hire him to do data entry or answer phones.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind-t">Here&#8217;s what I suggest:</p>
        <p class="list-1"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />You, Jamie, and I should
            work on a template for product descriptions that reflects the brand personality we came up with last year.
        </p>
        <p class="lists"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />Once we have that, we
            could hire a part-time person on a contract basis to go through the site, pull the product descriptions into
            compliance with the new template, and flag any missing content.</p>
        <p class="lists"><img src="../Images/common.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />Once we&#8217;ve cleaned
            things up, we can decide where to go from there.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind-t">I&#8217;ll follow up tomorrow to see if we can put something on the calendar.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Thanks!</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Sarah</p>
        <p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_32"></span>In this revised version, Sarah has thought
            about Mary&#8217;s potential response. What&#8217;s in it for Mary now? More than just more money going out
            the door. The current proposal creates an opportunity to implement the branding they&#8217;ve already
            invested in, a better experience online for customers, and the potential to use Jamie for what he was hired
            to do. Sarah has thought more about the situation and realized that they might not need the contractor
            forever, and they might not need another full-time person&#8212;but if they do, Mary will understand why.

                <h3 class="heada-n"><span class="bold">Writing for a Group of Readers</span></h3>
                <p class="noindent1s-n">Writing for your reader is straightforward when you have just one reader. It
                    becomes more complicated when you&#8217;re writing for a group. In a situation like that, you have
                    to assume that your readers might have different points of view and, perhaps, different needs. How
                    do you strategize when you&#8217;re writing for a group of readers? To help focus your efforts, try
                    asking yourself some questions: Which of your readers is the most senior? Who&#8217;s the
                    decision-maker? Who&#8217;s going to be the hardest to convince? Who&#8217;s likely to object and
                    why? Once you&#8217;ve done this analysis, you can anticipate readers&#8217; objections.</p>
                <p class="indents-n">But what if you&#8217;re writing for a group that includes people you don&#8217;t
                    know, as often happens when you&#8217;re submitting a proposal? In that sort of situation, take a
                    page from the marketers&#8217; book and create personas&#8212;fictional readers who are typical of
                    the kinds of people reading your writing. For instance, you might imagine a more senior manager than
                    the one you&#8217;re submitting the proposal to. You might imagine a reader concerned about budget.
                    You might picture a reader <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_33"></span>who has another solution
                    in mind. Don&#8217;t let yourself become overwhelmed by thinking about all of these potential
                    readers; rather, use your insights about them to make sure your writing addresses each of their
                    needs, at least in a preliminary way. Don&#8217;t let them freak you out; let them help you. When
                    you&#8217;re writing for a group, thinking about your potential readers can help you anticipate
                    reasonable objections and make a stronger argument in the process.</p>

        <h2 class="h2">How to Write for Your Reader</h2>
        <p class="noindent1">If you like to <span class="bold">plan</span> before you write, the following trick can
            help you craft your message to appeal to your reader. In Step 1, <span class="italic">Get the ask
                clear,</span> you did an exercise designed to help pinpoint your purpose in writing. Now take what you
            did there and expand it. As you plan your draft, try completing these two very useful sentences:</p>
        <p class="hang1a"><span class="italic">My purpose is to</span> <span class="us">_______</span> <span
                class="italic">so that my reader will</span> <span class="us">_______</span><span
                class="italic">.</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">My reader needs to understand</span> <span class="us">_______</span> <span
                class="italic">to be able to do that.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">If you&#8217;re an <span class="bold">editor</span> rather than a planner and have a draft
            you&#8217;re revising, try reading your draft from your reader&#8217;s point of view. Ask yourself:</p>
        <p class="hang1a"><span class="italic">If I were [insert name of reader], I would think</span> <span
                class="us">_______</span><span class="italic">.</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">If I were [insert name of reader], I would want to know</span> <span
                class="us">_______</span><span class="italic">.</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">If I were [insert name of reader], I would react better if</span> <span
                class="us">_______</span><span class="italic">.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">For both planners and editors, putting yourself in your reader&#8217;s shoes can help you
            anticipate objections and connect more successfully with your reader.</p>

                        Global Teams</span></h3>
                <p class="noindent1s-n">With the rise of virtual teaming, many of us are now frequently working with
                    people from other countries and other cultures. And because those team members live in diverse
                    places, our only interaction with them might be in writing. When you&#8217;re working with a global
                    team, take some precautions to help promote understanding and prevent offense.</p>
                <p class="indents-n">Here are a few tips that can keep global teams communicating smoothly:</p>
                <p class="lists1"><img src="../Images/common1.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />Get
                    everyone&#8217;s name right. You might find yourself on a team with people who have names that are
                    unfamiliar to you. Take the time to learn how to spell and pronounce everyone&#8217;s name
                    correctly. If you&#8217;re not sure, ask; people would rather be asked than have their names
                    mangled.</p>
                <p class="lists0"><img src="../Images/common1.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />Avoid using
                    jargon. Even for people who know English very well, some business jargon&#8212;especially jargon
                    based in &#173;metaphor&#8212;might not make much sense. Instead of writing, &#8220;let&#8217;s not
                    boil the ocean,&#8221; write, &#8220;let&#8217;s not do more work than we need to do.&#8221; Instead
                    of suggesting that the team start with &#8220;low-hanging fruit,&#8221; suggest they start with
                    &#8220;problems that are easy to solve.&#8221; (Even when you&#8217;re writing for a domestic
                    audience, it&#8217;s a good idea to keep expressions like this to a minimum.)</p>
                <p class="lists0"><img src="../Images/common1.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />If someone
                    writes something you don&#8217;t understand, take the time to clarify it. Don&#8217;t assume you
                    know what it means&#8212;ask.</p>
                <p class="lists0"><img src="../Images/common1.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />Tread carefully
                    around saying no. Some cultures are uncomfortable with refusing requests and otherwise saying no. In
                    some cultures, a direct refusal can cause people <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_35"></span>to
                    lose face, so bad news is delivered indirectly. If your colleague seems to be communicating vaguely
                    or not answering questions, they might be trying to say no without coming right out and saying it.
                    Try rephrasing your question, summarizing what you think your colleague means, and being gently
                    persistent to be sure you understand what the message really is.</p>
                <p class="lists0"><img src="../Images/common1.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />Give everyone
                    the benefit of the doubt. If someone&#8217;s tone sounds peculiar to you, you might just be reacting
                    to a different cultural norm.</p>
                <p class="lists0"><img src="../Images/common1.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />Always err on
                    the side of courtesy. It&#8217;s better to be a bit more formal than usual than to risk hurting
                    someone&#8217;s feelings.</p>

                        Objections</span></h3>
                <p class="noindent1s-n">There&#8217;s a strategic element to most communication, even if the stakes
                    don&#8217;t seem very high. Part of strategy is anticipating and preempting the moves of the other.
                    If you&#8217;re writing to try to get something from someone&#8212;whether it&#8217;s a sale,
                    funding for a project, or an agreement to an approach&#8212;it&#8217;s smart to think about how your
                    reader is likely to respond and anticipate any objections they might raise.</p>
                <p class="indents-n">Anticipating objections requires really understanding your reader, so that you can
                    see the matter from her point of view. Is she in charge of the budget? What other demands is she
                    facing? Why should she allocate money to your project rather than to others? What other demands is
                    he dealing with besides your request? Will he have time to address your issue on top of everything
                    else? How can you make your issue a priority for him, given his competing priorities? Is this a bad
                    time for the organization to take risks? How can you convince your reader that the upside outweighs
                    the potential downside? Anticipating and addressing objections in advance can help prevent the
                    reader from rejecting your idea out of hand, and it can shorten any discussion or negotiation that
                    might follow your initial communication.</p>

                    &#8220;you&#8221; attitude in your writing often involves changing the subject of the sentence from
                    &#8220;I&#8221; or &#8220;we&#8221; to &#8220;you&#8221;:</p>

                        Guide Your Reader</span></h3>
                <p class="noindent1s-n">Part of writing for your reader is doing your best to ensure that your message
                    is easy to understand. In addition to selecting content carefully, you can make your message more
                    accessible by using formatting that will help your reader absorb your message. Most people at work
                    don&#8217;t really read text&#8212;they scan it. These three tricks can make text more easily
                    scannable and highlight content that might be impor&#173;tant to your reader:</p>
                <p class="lists1"><img src="../Images/common1.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />Use short
                    paragraphs. The eye tends to &#8220;bounce&#8221; off text set in long paragraphs. A series of
                    paragraphs of <span class="bold">a few sentences each</span> will be much easier for your reader to
                    scan.</p>
                <p class="lists0"><img src="../Images/common1.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />Use bulleted
                    lists. Whenever you have <span class="bold">a list of items</span>, consider formatting it as a
                    bulleted list. The list might be single words, sentences, or questions. A word of caution:
                    don&#8217;t try to force content into bulleted lists if the elements aren&#8217;t parallel or if
                    they need fuller development than a simple list can provide. Some business writers have gone
                    overboard with the bullets&#8212;if you use them, make sure they make sense.</p>
                <p class="lists0"><img src="../Images/common1.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />Use strategic
                    bolding. Strategic bolding <span class="bold">highlights important words</span> and <span
                        class="bold">draws the reader&#8217;s eye to them</span>. If a passage has effective strategic
                    bolding, the reader should be able to <span class="bold">glance at it and get the gist of it</span>,
                    rather than reading it word for word. As with bullet points, be careful not to overdo it. <span
                        class="bold">If you bold too much</span> of your text, the bolding becomes meaningless noise and
                    <span class="bold">can have the opposite of the intended effect</span>.</p>
                <p class="indent1s-n-l"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_39"></span>A final word of caution:
                    don&#8217;t go nuts with any of these formatting techniques. If your text is too full of bulleted
                    lists, bolding, and italics, it&#8217;s going to look like a sales letter. You also risk organizing
                    your writing around the formatting, rather than focusing on developing the content itself. Use
                    formatting as a tool and let it serve you, rather than your serving it. When used skillfully,
                    formatting can help you organize content and direct your reader&#8217;s eye to what&#8217;s really
                    important.</p>

        <p class="noindent1">A lot of people have trouble writing introductions and other openings. Getting started on
            anything can be challenging. It can be especially difficult when you&#8217;re trying to introduce a message
            or document that doesn&#8217;t exist yet&#8212;that is, writing an introduction before you&#8217;ve written
            the rest of the draft.</p>
        <p class="indent">But beginnings make a big impression. Readers typically decide within seconds how
            they&#8217;re going to deal with a message or document. If your document starts out loose and sloppy and
            meandering, you risk losing your reader&#8217;s attention. To engage your reader and motivate her to

        <p class="indent1">Eric does a good job of laying out the impact of Dalia&#8217;s maternity leave and proposing
            some solutions, but if Jessica just skims the beginning of this message, she won&#8217;t understand the
            urgency of the situation or that Eric is asking for her response. Eric doesn&#8217;t let Jessica know till

            him, but it might not be for Jessica. It&#8217;s better for him to be explicit about the need and the

        <p class="indent1">In this version, Eric has made the opening of his message strong and specific: there is time
            pressure, and he&#8217;s offering suggestions that he wants Jessica&#8217;s opinion about. He begins his
            message by letting Jessica know that there is information below she needs to read and respond to, thus
            motivating her to read the whole message.</p>
        <h2 class="h2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_44"></span>How to Start Strong and Specific</h2>
        <p class="noindent1">Beginnings can be difficult, but there are a couple of ways you can take the pressure off
            when it comes to writing your openings. First, be aware that you don&#8217;t have to write your beginning
            first (see the box &#8220;You Don&#8217;t Have to Start at the Beginning&#8221; <a target="_blank"
                href="12_Chapter03.xhtml#page_46">here</a>). Second, it&#8217;s always a good idea to go back and revise
            your opening after you&#8217;ve completed a full draft. If you make a habit of revising your beginning
            before you finalize your document, you can be sure not only that your opening is attractive to readers but
            also that it accurately represents what follows in the rest of the document.</p>
        <p class="indent">If you&#8217;re the type of writer who likes to <span class="bold">plan</span> before you
            write, take a minute and ask yourself:</p>
        <p class="hang1a"><span class="italic">How can I grab my reader?</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">What will make my reader want to keep reading?</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">In Step 2, you spent some time analyzing your reader. Use what you learned in that step to
            plan an opening that will appeal to him. What will your reader think is important about this message? A
            <span class="bold">risk/&#173;opportunity analysis</span> is a good place to start: Is there <span
                class="bold">risk</span> your reader wants to avoid? Is there an <span class="bold">opportunity</span>
            he doesn&#8217;t want to miss? Whatever that issue is, figure out how to get it up front in your message or
            document. You don&#8217;t have to explain all the details of the issue at the beginning, but you do have to
            raise it. Once you have the opening planned, think about how you can arrange your content to motivate
            readers to continue reading. Sometimes it&#8217;s as easy as saying something like &#8220;I&#8217;m
            proposing three potential solutions below.&#8221; Whatever you do, don&#8217;t bury important
            information&#8212;such as deadline and next steps&#8212;at the end. Front-load as much as you can, fill in
            the details in the middle, and use your conclusion as a reinforcement.</p>
        <p class="indent">If you&#8217;re an <span class="bold">editor</span>, the type of writer who likes to draft
            first and then revise, be sure you go back to the beginning of your draft with a critical eye. Put yourself
            in your reader&#8217;s shoes, and ask:</p>
        <p class="hang1a"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_45"></span><span class="italic">Is this something
                I&#8217;d want to read?</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">Would I read through to the end of this message?</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">If the answer is no, consider how you might grab your reader&#8217;s attention. Is there an
            opportunity or risk you can bring to the fore to get her attention? Can you say something in the beginning
            to motivate her to read the whole thing?</p>
        <p class="indent">No matter if you&#8217;re writing a quick e-mail or a long report, it&#8217;s important to be
            sure your opening is clear and that you&#8217;re saying it in a way that will catch your reader&#8217;s
            attention.</p>
        <p class="indent">Whether you&#8217;re a <span class="bold">planner</span> or an <span
                class="bold">editor</span>, it&#8217;s a good idea to double-check your opening before you send your
            document off to the reader. Especially with longer documents, ideas often shift while you&#8217;re writing,
            and your original opening might not accurately reflect what follows. When you review, you might have more
            clarity about your purpose and how you&#8217;re going to appeal to your reader. As you review, ask yourself:
        </p>
        <p class="hang1a"><span class="italic">Is it clear to my reader why I&#8217;m writing?</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">Is my reader incentivized to keep reading?</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">Does my tone support my message?</span> (For more information on tone, see
            the box &#8220;Does This Sound Okay?&#8221; <a target="_blank" href="12_Chapter03.xhtml#page_92">here</a>.)

                        Have to Start at the Beginning</span></h3>
                <p class="noindent1s-n">Introductions and other kinds of beginnings can be difficult to write. A lot is
                    riding on the opening of your document, and getting started can be intimidating. The good news is
                    that you don&#8217;t have to start your draft by writing the beginning of it. In fact, the beginning
                    might <span class="italic">not</span> be the best thing to start with.</p>
                <p class="indents-n">Don&#8217;t get hung up on writing your introduction, especially when you&#8217;re
                    working on a long document like a report or proposal. Start wherever you feel most confident. That
                    might be somewhere in the middle of the document, a section where you feel you have the most to say
                    or can make the most compelling argument. Go ahead and complete that section, and move on from
                    there. If it helps, you can try writing the document piece by piece, not necessarily in order. Once
                    you have a full draft, you can put the pieces together, smooth out the transitions, and then write
                    the introduction. By this point you&#8217;ll know exactly what you&#8217;re introducing, and
                    you&#8217;ll know what you want to emphasize in your introduction to guide the reader&#8217;s
                    attention. Very often, introductions that are written last are stronger and more specific than ones
                    that are drafted at the beginning.</p>

        <p class="noindent1">In the next step, we&#8217;ll look at ways to make the best possible use of your
            reader&#8217;s time and attention by writing concisely.</p>

        <p class="epi"><span class="italic">&#8220;Most of the e-mails I get should be 30&#8211;50% shorter than they
                are.&#8221;</span></p>

        <p class="noindent1">In Step 1 you got the ask clear, in Step 2 you tailored your message for your reader, and
            in Step 3 you wrote a strong beginning. In this step, you&#8217;ll learn to make your writing more concise.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">In the business writing survey I conducted for this book, 87 percent of respondents indicated
            that writing more concisely was a priority for them, and 63 percent said they wished their colleagues would
            write more concisely.</p>
        <p class="indent">The ability to write concisely has a lot of benefits&#8212;for your reader, obviously, and
            also for you. Concise writing tends to get a better response, because your readers will quickly learn what
            you want. If you get in the habit of writing concisely, you&#8217;ll spend less time writing and
            you&#8217;ll agonize less over what you write. You&#8217;ll also spend less time following up with people
            who didn&#8217;t understand&#8212;or didn&#8217;t even read&#8212;what you wrote. Finally, if you make it a
            habit, you&#8217;ll get a reputation as someone who&#8217;s straightforward and doesn&#8217;t waste
            people&#8217;s time&#8212;and everyone likes that kind of colleague.</p>
        <p class="indent">For most of us, writing concisely doesn&#8217;t come naturally, especially when we&#8217;re in
            a hurry. When we&#8217;re in a rush, we tend to write whatever comes into our heads, and it&#8217;s often
            muddy, wordy, and too long. It takes a little time to break the habit of going on too long. As you practice,
            it begins to come more naturally.</p>
        <p class="indent">Before we get started, a little caveat: shorter is not <span class="italic">always</span>
            better. Sometimes you want a particular tone or style that involves longer sentences, more explanation, or
            repetition to drive your point home. The key is to do whatever you do&#8212;whether writing concisely or
            more expansively&#8212;by choice, not from lack of skill.</p>
        <p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_48"></span>Writing concisely involves learning a few
            editing techniques. There are practically endless ways to edit your writing, and it&#8217;s easy to feel
            overwhelmed before you even start. In this section, you&#8217;ll learn a quick, practical method that will
            cover about 90 percent of your problems with wordiness. If you want to learn even more, look at the section
            on editing your own writing later in the book (see <a target="_blank"
                href="16_Chapter07.xhtml#page_191">here</a>).</p>
        <p class="indent">To give you the power to make your sentences more concise, we&#8217;re going to look at a
            little grammar (not too much, I promise). Here are four tips you can use to cut the chaff in your writing:
        </p>
        <p class="num1">1.<span class="space" />Watch for forms of the verb &#8220;to be&#8221;: (&#8220;is,&#8221;
            &#8220;are,&#8221; &#8220;was,&#8221; &#8220;were,&#8221; &#8220;has been,&#8221; &#8220;have been,&#8221;
            etc.).</p>
        <p class="num">2.<span class="space" />Watch for prepositional phrases.</p>
        <p class="num">3.<span class="space" />Watch for nominalizations (explained below).</p>
        <p class="num">4.<span class="space" />Watch for padding.</p>
        <p class="indent1">If you can detect just these four patterns in your own writing and learn to make adjustments
            when you find them, you will greatly improve your prose and make your readers&#8217; lives much easier.</p>

            Be&#8221;</h2>
        <p class="noindent1">The verb &#8220;to be&#8221; in all its various forms&#8212;&#8220;I am,&#8221; &#8220;you
            are,&#8221; &#8220;she or he is,&#8221; &#8220;they are,&#8221; &#8220;we have been&#8221;&#8212;occurs more
            frequently than any other verb in English. It&#8217;s a perfectly fine verb, but relying on it too much can
            make your sentences longer than they need to be. We&#8217;ll look at two ways that &#8220;to be&#8221; can
            creep into your writing and make it loose and meandering: the <span class="bold">passive voice</span> and
            &#8220;<span class="bold">there is</span>&#8221; forms.</p>
        <h3 class="h3">The Passive Voice</h3>
        <p class="noindent">Forms of the verb &#8220;to be&#8221; can signal the presence of the passive voice in your
            sentence. You&#8217;ve probably heard of the passive voice, but you might not be entirely sure what this
            sentence structure is. It&#8217;s called passive because the subject of the sentence is receiving the action
            of the sentence. Its opposite is the <span class="bold">active voice</span>, where the subject of the
            sentence is doing the action of the sentence. The passive voice is formed using the past participle of a
            verb (often ending in &#8220;-ed&#8221;) and a form of the verb &#8220;to be.&#8221; Because the subject of
            the sentence isn&#8217;t doing the action, it&#8217;s often necessary to add a phrase beginning with
            &#8220;by&#8221; to indicate who did it.</p>
        <p class="indent">Let&#8217;s look at some examples.</p>
        <p class="hang1a">Passive voice: <span class="italic">The intruder</span> was arrested <span class="italic">by
                the security guard.</span></p>
        <p class="hang1">Active voice: <span class="italic">The security guard</span> arrested <span class="italic">the
                intruder.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">In the passive voice version, the subject of the sentence, &#8220;the intruder,&#8221; is
            being acted upon. In the active version, the subject of the sentence, &#8220;security guard,&#8221; is
            performing the action.</p>
        <p class="hang1a">Passive voice: <span class="italic">Gender and annual income</span> were cited <span
                class="italic">by the research as the major drivers of purchase decisions.</span></p>
        <p class="hang1">Active voice: <span class="italic">The research</span> cited <span class="italic">gender and
                annual income</span> <span class="italic">as the major drivers of purchase decisions.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_51"></span>As you can see, the &#8220;action&#8221; of a
            verb isn&#8217;t always physical action&#8212;it&#8217;s the &#8220;doing&#8221; part of the sentence. In
            the example above, &#8220;the research&#8221; is doing the action, which is <span
                class="italic">citing</span>.</p>
        <p class="hang1a">Passive: <span class="italic">The beginning of the recession</span> was signaled <span
                class="italic">by a sharp dip in stock prices.</span></p>
        <p class="hang1">Active<span class="italic">: A sharp dip in stock prices</span> signaled <span
                class="italic">the beginning of the recession.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">The action in this example is <span class="italic">signaling</span>, and it&#8217;s the dip
            in stock prices that&#8217;s doing it.</p>
        <p class="indent">In all these examples, you can see that the passive version is longer than the active version.
            Usually it&#8217;s a difference of just a few words, but if you make a habit of relying on the passive voice
            and string together a whole paragraph of passive constructions, you can end up with a lot of verbiage you
            don&#8217;t need.</p>
        <p class="hang1">Sometimes the actor in a passive sentence is omitted altogether:</p>
        <p class="hang1a"><span class="italic">Bus and subway fares</span> <span class="bolditalic">were
                raised</span><span class="italic">.</span> [By whom? Surely not by the MTA?]</p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">Mistakes</span> <span class="bolditalic">were made</span> <span
                class="italic">in dealing with the crisis.</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="bolditalic">It was determined</span> <span class="italic">that the proper
                procedure</span> <span class="bolditalic">had been followed</span><span class="italic">.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">Looking at examples like these, you can see how using the passive voice might be a handy way
            to avoid taking responsibility, and some writers use it for exactly that reason.</p>
        <p class="indent">It&#8217;s important to point out that passive constructions aren&#8217;t incorrect. In fact,
            sometimes they&#8217;re exactly what you need. You might use a passive construction when you don&#8217;t
            know who did the action:</p>
        <p class="hang1a"><span class="italic">The alarm was tripped at 4:30 this morning.</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">The fence was blown down for a third time.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">And sometimes you genuinely want to emphasize the object of the action, rather than the
            actor:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1b-n"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_52"></span><span class="italic">Seating
                arrangements at the event caused some controversy. Corporate representatives sat at the lower tables.
                The main table was occupied by the mayor and his special guests.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">The last sentence in this short passage is in the passive voice, but it&#8217;s a good
            choice. It&#8217;s sensible to make &#8220;the main table&#8221; the subject of the sentence: the real issue
            is the seating arrangements, rather than the mayor and his pals.</p>
        <p class="indent">Although the passive voice is grammatically correct and sometimes preferable, you&#8217;re
            usually better off favoring the active voice in business writing. Many business writers fall into the habit
            of depending on the passive voice because they see other writers doing it. The sound gets into their heads
            as the proper sound of business and professional writing, and they simply replicate what they hear. However,
            active constructions have advantages over passive ones: they&#8217;re shorter, they&#8217;re more direct,
            they&#8217;re easier to read, and they&#8217;re more engaging. They sound more personal&#8212;that
            impersonal, businessy, &#8220;official&#8221; tone isn&#8217;t always what you want&#8212;and they create a
            sense of agency in the sentence: there&#8217;s a person (or a thing sometimes) who&#8217;s taking action.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">As with any other style choice, your use of the passive or active voice should be your
            decision rather than something you fall into because you don&#8217;t know how to control it. Learning to
            convert passive constructions into active ones, and vice versa, gives you more control over your own
            writing.</p>
        <p class="indent">So how do you change a passive construction into an active one? Follow these three steps:</p>
        <p class="num1a">1.<span class="space" />Diagnose the passive voice by looking for forms of the verb &#8220;to
            be,&#8221; like &#8220;is,&#8221; &#8220;are,&#8221; &#8220;has been,&#8221; &#8220;have been,&#8221; and so
            on, plus the past participle of the verb (usually ending in &#8220;-ed&#8221;). Passive sentences will
            sometimes contain phrases beginning with &#8220;by&#8221; to indicate who or what is doing the action.</p>
        <p class="numa">2.<span class="space" />Ask yourself who or what is <span class="italic">doing</span> the acting
            in the sentence, and who or what is <span class="italic">receiving</span> the action.</p>
        <p class="numa"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_53"></span>3.<span class="space" />Flip the sentence so the
            actor is the subject.</p>
        <p class="indent1">Let&#8217;s try an example:</p>
        <p class="indent1"><span class="italic">The models are used by the teams to project revenue.</span></p>
        <p class="num1a">1.<span class="space" />Form of the verb &#8220;to be&#8221; followed by a past participle?
            Yes, &#8220;are used.&#8221;</p>
        <p class="numa">2.<span class="space" />Who or what is doing the acting in the sentence? It&#8217;s <span
                class="italic">the teams</span>.</p>
        <p class="numa">3.<span class="space" />Flip the sentence so that the actor is the subject:</p>
        <p class="indent1"><span class="italic">The teams use the models to project revenue.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">You can see that the revision isn&#8217;t just shorter, it&#8217;s also clearer and more
            direct.</p>
        <p class="indent">Here are a few samples for you to practice on. (Solutions are at the bottom of this page.)</p>

        <p class="noindent1">(Notice that in the last sentence, the person doing the replacing doesn&#8217;t even

        <h3 class="h3">&#8220;<span class="italic">There Is,&#8221; &#8220;There Are,&#8221; &#8220;It Is&#8221;</span>
        </h3>
        <p class="noindent">Forms of the verb &#8220;to be&#8221; can also signal the presence of filler phrases like
            &#8220;there is,&#8221; &#8220;there are,&#8221; and &#8220;it is.&#8221; These are not passive
            constructions, and they&#8217;re not incorrect. However, they don&#8217;t add meaning, they can create an
            impersonal and distant feel, and they waste <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_54"></span>space. Once you
            learn to spot them, you can tighten up your writing considerably.</p>
        <p class="hang1a"><span class="bold">Original:</span> <span class="italic">There is a large group of potential

        <p class="indent1">Used occasionally, &#8220;there is&#8221; and &#8220;it is&#8221; constructions can help you
            vary your style and add interest to your writing. As a steady diet, though, they can slow things down and
            make your writing feel impersonal. Be careful they don&#8217;t become a habit.</p>
        <p class="indent">Becoming aware of how you use&#8212;or overuse&#8212;the verb &#8220;to be&#8221; can help you
            tighten and strengthen your writing. Of course, the verb &#8220;to be&#8221; has plenty of legitimate uses.
            But when you rely on it too much, your writing can become bloated. Paying attention to your &#8220;to
            be&#8221; habits can help you in your quest to make your writing more concise.</p>
        <h2 class="h2">2. Watch for Prepositional Phrases</h2>
        <p class="noindent1">A preposition is a part of speech defined as &#8220;a word or group of words that is used
            with a noun, pronoun, or noun phrase to show direction, location, or time, or to introduce an
            object.&#8221;<sup><a epub:type="noteref" id="fn-2" href="12_Chapter03.xhtml#fn_2">&#8727;</a></sup>
            That&#8217;s a pretty vague definition, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_55"></span>and it isn&#8217;t
            terrifically helpful on its own. But remembering the definition of prepositions is not as important as your
            ability to spot them and understand what they do.</p>
        <p class="indent">Prepositions are those words like &#8220;in,&#8221; &#8220;on,&#8221; &#8220;of,&#8221;
            &#8220;into,&#8221; &#8220;by,&#8221; &#8220;under,&#8221; &#8220;with,&#8221; &#8220;around,&#8221;
            &#8220;about,&#8221; and &#8220;between&#8221; that serve as connectors in a sentence. You&#8217;ll find a
            long list of common prepositions in Appendix B. They introduce <span class="bold">prepositional
                phrases</span>. A prepositional phrase begins with a preposition and has a noun or a pronoun as the
            <span class="bold">object of the preposition</span>. Like so:</p>
        <p class="hang1a"><span class="italic">about the customer</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">in the office</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">on the phone</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">by my authority</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">under these circumstances</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">of the organization</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">Like the passive voice, prepositional phrases are perfectly correct grammatical forms. It
            would be hard to write in English without using them. The problem comes when they&#8217;re overused. When
            writers try to sound &#8220;official,&#8221; they often fall into the trap of piling up prepositional
            phrases one after the other. Policy statements and anything else trying to sound legal often feature lots of
            prepositional phrases strung together. Learning to identify prepositions and the phrases that follow them is
            an important skill in making your writing more concise, so be on the lookout for phrases beginning with
            &#8220;of,&#8221; &#8220;by,&#8221; &#8220;in,&#8221; &#8220;for,&#8221; &#8220;about,&#8221;
            &#8220;with,&#8221; &#8220;through,&#8221; and other prepositions.</p>
        <p class="indent">Let&#8217;s look at an example:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1b-n"><span class="italic">Participation in client negotiations with suppliers is prohibited
                by company policy unless (in very rare circumstances) there is advance consent of a leader of the gyro
                division in the client&#8217;s geography as well as an industry leader for the supplier&#8217;s
                industry.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_56"></span>Whoa. Most people can recognize this kind of
            writing as bad. It&#8217;s a little harder to identify exactly what&#8217;s wrong (it&#8217;s prepositional
            phrases and forms of the verb &#8220;to be&#8221;) and understand how to fix it. Let&#8217;s take this
            sentence apart. The prepositional phrases are in italics, and the &#8220;to be&#8221; forms are in bold:</p>
        <p class="hang1a">Participation</p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">in client negotiations</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">with suppliers</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="bold">is prohibited</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">by company policy</span>, unless</p>
        <p class="hang1">(<span class="italic">in very rare circumstances</span>) <span class="bold">there
                is</span><span class="bold"></span> advance consent</p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">of a leader</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">of the gyro division</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">in the client&#8217;s geography</span> as well as an industry leader</p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">for the supplier&#8217;s industry</span>.</p>
        <p class="indent1">That&#8217;s a lot of prepositional phrases all strung together. How do we fix it? The first
            step is to figure out what the message is and say it in plain English.</p>
        <p class="indent">Here&#8217;s a colloquial &#8220;translation&#8221; of the passage:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n"><span class="italic">You can&#8217;t participate in client negotiations with suppliers
                unless a leader in the gyro division and a leader in the supplier&#8217;s industry say it&#8217;s
                okay.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">That version is probably too informal to use, but doing this kind of commonsense check can
            help you sort out what&#8217;s really going on in a sentence burdened with too many prepositional phrases.
            With only minor revisions, you can turn this version into something you can use:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n"><span class="italic">You may not participate in client negotiations with suppliers
                unless a leader in the gyro division and a leader in the supplier&#8217;s industry consent.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_57"></span>Although the prepositional phrases were the
            main culprit in the sentence, we also cleaned up a couple of forms of the verb &#8220;to be.&#8221;
            &#8220;Participation . . . <span class="bold">is prohibited</span>&#8221; became &#8220;you may not
            participate,&#8221; and &#8220;unless . . . <span class="bold">there is</span> advance consent&#8221; became
            &#8220;unless a leader . . . and a leader . . . consent.&#8221; (You&#8217;ll often find loose forms of the
            verb &#8220;to be&#8221; in sentences that have strings of prepositional phrases.)</p>
        <p class="indent">So what&#8217;s the remedy? Here are three techniques you can use to fix sentences that are
            overburdened with prepositional phrases:</p>

        <p class="num1b">1.<span class="space" />Look for the action in the sentence or clause: What is the action, and
            who&#8217;s doing it?</p>
        <p class="indent1">Our original sentence read: &#8220;unless there is advance consent of a leader of the gyro
            division.&#8221; What&#8217;s the action there, and who&#8217;s doing that action? The action is
            &#8220;consent,&#8221; and the person giving consent is a leader. So we can revise to &#8220;unless a leader

        <p class="indent1">Once you become attuned to spotting prepositions and prepositional phrases, you&#8217;ll see
            them everywhere. Most of them are probably fine. But when you start accumulating a lot of them, you usually
            end up with unnecessary length. Trimming prepositional phrases can help you make your writing more concise
            and efficient.</p>
        <h2 class="h2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_58"></span>3. Watch for Nominalizations</h2>
        <p class="noindent1">What the heck is &#8220;nominalization&#8221;? It&#8217;s taking a verb or adjective,
            turning it into a noun, and then adding more words to the sentence or phrase to make it mean what it meant
            in the first place.</p>
        <p class="indent">Maybe an example would help. Look at the phrases below and see if you can recognize
            what&#8217;s going on here:</p>
        <p class="hang1a"><span class="italic">Reach an agreement</span> = <span class="italic">agree</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">Make a decision</span> = <span class="italic">decide</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">Achieve a balance</span> = <span class="italic">balance</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">Suffer a loss</span> = <span class="italic">lose</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">Have a response</span> = <span class="italic">respond</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">Conduct an investigation</span> = <span class="italic">investigate</span>
        </p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">Have applicability = apply</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">Engage in a search</span> = <span class="italic">search</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">The words on the right-hand side of the equal signs are all perfectly good verbs that someone
            felt the need to nominalize&#8212;that is, to turn into a noun. Then, because the verb had become a noun,
            the writer needed an additional verb to do the work needed in the sentence. So because &#8220;search&#8221;
            somehow wasn&#8217;t good enough, someone changed it to &#8220;conduct a search,&#8221; adding words but not
            meaning.</p>
        <p class="indent">Nominalization isn&#8217;t grammatically incorrect, but it&#8217;s a very common bad habit in
            business writing. It&#8217;s usually done to create writing that sounds official and objective. It adds
            length without contributing additional meaning.</p>
        <p class="indent">You&#8217;ll often see nominalization in sentences that feature prepositional phrases and the
            passive voice. They&#8217;re all part of the common impulse in business writing to make sentences longer so
            that they&#8217;ll sound more authoritative. The cure for nominalization is to convert these phrases back to
            the original verb or adjective they came from.</p>

                &#8220;performing better.&#8221;)</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">Most writers aren&#8217;t even aware that they&#8217;re using nominalizations; they&#8217;re
            just trying to make their writing sound more &#8220;businesslike.&#8221; Once you become aware of the
            pattern, it&#8217;s easy to recognize it and to say what you mean in a clearer and more straightforward way.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2">4. Watch for Padding</h2>
        <p class="noindent1">We&#8217;ve looked at how relying on the verb &#8220;to be&#8221; can make a sentence long
            and sloppy. We&#8217;ve looked at how prepositional phrases and nominalizations can make sentences
            unnecessarily long. Now let&#8217;s look at padding&#8212;that is, using more words than you need.</p>
        <p class="indent">There are lots of ways to pad a sentence. Two of the most common are using <span
                class="bold">redundancies</span> and relying on <span class="bold">filler words and phrases</span> that
            don&#8217;t add meaning.</p>
        <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Redundancy</span> in writing is unnecessary repetition. Here are some
            common redundancies that might look familiar to you:</p>
        <p class="hang1a"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_60"></span>10 a.m. in the morning (&#8220;a.m.&#8221;
            means &#8220;in the morning&#8221;)</p>
        <p class="hang1">Absolutely essential (if something is essential, it&#8217;s essential; something can&#8217;t be
            &#8220;sort of essential&#8221;)</p>
        <p class="hang1">Advance warning (all warnings occur in advance)</p>
        <p class="hang1">Basic fundamentals (fundamentals are basic)</p>
        <p class="hang1">Current trend (unless you&#8217;re writing about a historical trend)</p>
        <p class="hang1">Final conclusion (a conclusion is final)</p>
        <p class="hang1">Follow after (&#8220;follow&#8221; is enough)</p>
        <p class="hang1">Merge together (&#8220;merge&#8221; implies &#8220;together&#8221;)</p>
        <p class="hang1">Group together (&#8220;grouping&#8221; is putting things together)</p>
        <p class="hang1">Future plans (all plans are for the future; you can&#8217;t plan for the past)</p>
        <p class="hang1">Postpone till later (&#8220;postpone&#8221; means reschedule for later)</p>
        <p class="hang1">Still remains (&#8220;remains&#8221; implies &#8220;still&#8221;)</p>
        <p class="hang1">Unintentional mistake (if it was a mistake, it was not intentional)</p>
        <p class="indent1">Some writers use redundancies as rhetorical devices, for emphasis.</p>
        <p class="blockquote1b-n"><span class="italic">Sales and marketing would like us to increase production to meet
                the spike in demand. But in actual fact, we cannot increase production that quickly, so we need to find
                a way to engage the market realistically given our current limited capacity.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">In this example, &#8220;actual fact&#8221; is a redundancy (all facts are actual facts), but
            the writer has used this expression to emphasize his point that sales and marketing are asking for something
            that&#8217;s not realistic.</p>
        <p class="indent">Most of the time, though, writers use redundancies unconsciously. It&#8217;s a bad habit you
            have to break.</p>
        <p class="indent">An occasional redundancy isn&#8217;t such a big deal, unless you&#8217;re a real stickler. The
            problem comes when this kind of writing expands and becomes ingrained. This habit feeds into the tendency of
            some business writers to write unnecessarily long and needlessly complex sentences, trying to sound
            professional and authoritative. Consider a sentence like this:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_61"></span><span class="italic">Everybody must
                share a clear common understanding of the company&#8217;s key risks and a clear line of sight into the
                overall general level of exposure to those risks.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">You can see there&#8217;s repetition in the sentence (&#8220;clear&#8221;), but there&#8217;s
            also significant redundancy. When &#8220;everybody&#8221; has an understanding, it&#8217;s already
            &#8220;shared.&#8221; If it&#8217;s a common understanding, then everybody has it. So the beginning of a
            revised version of this sentence might go something like this:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n"><span class="italic">Everybody must share an understanding of the company&#8217;s key
                risks . . .</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">What about &#8220;a clear line of sight&#8221;? Doesn&#8217;t that just mean
            &#8220;understand&#8221;? And what&#8217;s the difference between &#8220;overall&#8221; and
            &#8220;general&#8221;? Aren&#8217;t they the same?</p>
        <p class="indent">So how about this version instead:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n"><span class="italic">Everybody must share an understanding of the company&#8217;s key
                risks and its level of exposure to those risks.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">You could even take it this far, if you wanted to trim more:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n"><span class="italic">Everybody must understand the company&#8217;s key risks and its
                level of exposure to them.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">Let&#8217;s look at another example:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n"><span class="italic">The projected cost for the renovation is estimated at
                approximately $11 million.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">&#8220;Projected,&#8221; &#8220;is estimated,&#8221; and &#8220;approximately&#8221; all
            convey the same idea. One alternative version of this sentence:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n"><span class="italic">The projected cost for the renovation is $11 million.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_62"></span>Once you become attuned to redundancy in
            writing, you&#8217;ll begin to see it everywhere, and you&#8217;ll get better at stopping yourself from
            writing redundant prose. Your writing will be more concise and clearer, with a more natural voice.</p>
        <p class="indent">Another problem that can make your writing bloated is the habit of using <span
                class="bold">filler words and phrases</span> that don&#8217;t add meaning. Consider these overused words
            and phrases:</p>
        <p class="extract1">Actually</p>
        <p class="extract">A number of</p>
        <p class="extract">Apparently</p>
        <p class="extract">At the end of the day</p>
        <p class="extract">A variety of</p>
        <p class="extract">Basically</p>
        <p class="extract">Completely</p>
        <p class="extract">Currently</p>
        <p class="extract">Entire</p>
        <p class="extract">Honestly</p>
        <p class="extract">I just wanted to</p>
        <p class="extract">In many cases</p>
        <p class="extract">In many ways</p>
        <p class="extract">Literally</p>
        <p class="extract">Meaningful</p>
        <p class="extract">Significant</p>
        <p class="extract">Totally</p>
        <p class="extract">Very</p>
        <p class="extract">Whole</p>
        <p class="extract">With reference to</p>
        <p class="indent1">Of course, all these terms have meanings, and when they&#8217;re used precisely they
            contribute to the meaning of the sentence. The trouble is that they&#8217;re often dropped thoughtlessly
            into sentences where they contribute no meaning at all.</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n"><span class="italic">In many ways, the cost estimate is higher than expected.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="indent1">In <span class="italic">how many ways</span> was the estimate higher than expected? (How many
            ways <span class="italic">could</span> an estimate be higher than expected?) If there&#8217;s no answer to
            this question, the phrase is probably serving no purpose except to take up space.</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n"><span class="italic">With reference to the proposed expansion, I really don&#8217;t
                support this idea.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_63"></span>This sentence is awkward; getting rid of the
            filler can help:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n"><span class="italic">I don&#8217;t support the idea of expansion.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">Here&#8217;s another example:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1">Hi all,</p>
        <p class="blockquote">I just wanted to check in about the whole video production process. I totally agree with
            Sam that it&#8217;s very important to involve the full team at the kickoff meeting.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Felix</p>
        <p class="indent1">Felix&#8217;s entire first sentence feels like padding. His real message is in fact very
            brief:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1">Hi all,</p>
        <p class="blockquote">I agree with Sam that the whole team should be involved in the video kickoff meeting.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Thanks,</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Felix</p>
        <p class="indent1">Sometimes people pad their writing for social reasons&#8212;they want to sound friendly or
            they don&#8217;t want to sound abrupt. Consider if there are other ways to create a friendly tone in your
            communication, rather than padding your writing with meaningless phrases. In the second example above, the
            &#8220;Thanks&#8221; added to Felix&#8217;s brief message creates goodwill with his readers. It might take a
            minute or two of thought, but you can be concise and polite at the same time.</p>

                        Drafts</span></h3>
                <p class="noindent1s-n">It&#8217;s likely that every English teacher you ever had told you to work
                    through multiple drafts when you write. Maybe you did writing assignments in high school or college
                    that included writing a rough draft, getting feedback from the instructor, and then rewriting the
                    draft at least once. If you&#8217;re like most people, when you started writing at work you realized
                    you didn&#8217;t have a lot of time to get your writing done, so the idea of working with drafts
                    seems like an impossible luxury.</p>
                <p class="indents-n">While you might not have as much time as you&#8217;d like to polish your writing,
                    developing a sensible approach to working with drafts can improve your writing significantly and can
                    save you time in the long run.</p>
                <p class="indents-n">The reason working with drafts leads to better writing is that it allows for time
                    between iterations. During this time, you develop a different perspective on what you&#8217;ve
                    written, even if you&#8217;re continuing to think about it (or perhaps because you&#8217;re <span
                        class="italic">not</span> continuing to think about it). That different perspective helps you
                    catch errors, notice gaps in content, cut out extraneous information, and recognize that you might
                    have said something insensitive or politically unwise. Getting that little bit of distance can help
                    you take a more objective eye to your own writing.</p>
                <p class="indents-n">So the trick is to build in some time between iterations, even during your busy
                    workday. You probably won&#8217;t have a week to let your first draft rest, but can you find a day
                    between drafts? If not a day, how about a few hours? Some business writers do all their important
                    writing for the day first thing in the morning, when they feel fresh, and then <span
                        epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_65"></span>return to their drafts near the end of the day. The
                    time that&#8217;s passed during the workday lets them revisit and revise what they wrote in the
                    morning.</p>
                <p class="indents-n">If this kind of system won&#8217;t work for you, do whatever you can to take a
                    break after you write your first draft. For instance, try writing out a quick draft before you have
                    to go into a meeting, and then checking it before you need to send it out. Try grabbing a cup of
                    coffee between your first and second drafts. Do whatever you can within the confines of your busy
                    day to help yourself get some distance on your early drafts and enable you to make improvements in
                    later ones.</p>
                <p class="indents-n">It can be difficult to find additional time in the day, but devising a system that
                    allows you to work with drafts will save you time in the long run&#8212;your communications will be
                    clearer and more complete, and you&#8217;ll spend less time following up to clarify.</p>

                    Because we know that when someone has an important idea to convey&#8212;whether it is a director or
                    an author or whoever&#8212;they will take the time to do it right and give us their best effort.</p>
                <p class="indents-j">The same should be true for you and your business writing. Writing is rewriting (or
                    it should be). It doesn&#8217;t matter whether you are writing a blog, a letter, a proposal, or an
                    e-mail. You owe it to your reader&#8212;and, more importantly, to yourself&#8212;to take the time
                    and have it say what you really mean. And that requires some editing, plain and simple.</p>
                <p class="indents-j">Very few of us can put down on paper (or screen!) exactly what we want to say the
                    very first time we think it. Either the idea will be unformed, or it won&#8217;t come out exactly as
                    intended, or there will be typos. Whatever the case, it is vital, if you want your writing and ideas
                    to be both understood and taken seriously, that you take a little extra time, give the item a little
                    extra effort, and have it say precisely what you mean.</p>
                <p class="indents-j">Ask yourself this question: What would you think of a job applicant whose cover
                    letter got your address wrong, or contained typos, or used &#8220;i&#8221; instead of
                    &#8220;I&#8221;? You would likely think that the person is lazy, sloppy, or uneducated&#8212;or all
                    three. Yet that is the very risk you take when you don&#8217;t edit, review, and rewrite your
                    writing. Doing so will not only ensure that you avoid mistakes that can be damaging to your
                    business, brand, or career <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_67"></span>but will also mean that
                    the recipient will truly understand what it is you are trying to say.</p>
                <p class="indents-j">That will happen, however, only if you live by the mantra &#8220;Writing is
                    rewriting.&#8221;</p>

        <p class="noindent1">Most of us are writing in a hurry, and one of the biggest risks of writing in a hurry is
            making mistakes with content&#8212;either forgetting something or including too much. When you write a first
            draft, you tend to just splat out whatever is in your head. Sometimes you include information that
            isn&#8217;t really relevant. Sometimes you forget to include important content. That&#8217;s perfectly
            normal for a first draft, but before you send your document off to its final destination, you need to be
            sure you&#8217;ve included the right content.</p>
        <p class="indent">Forgetting important content usually has one of two possible outcomes. Either the reader zones
            out and gives up, or he has to follow up with you to get the content he needs, wasting time on both your
            parts.</p>
        <p class="indent">Including too much information can also make life harder for your reader. Extraneous content
            will force your reader to work to figure out why you&#8217;re saying all this and what she&#8217;s supposed
            to do about it. If your message ends up being too long and vague, your reader might give up entirely.</p>
        <p class="indent">A quick content check helps ensure that your readers are getting exactly what they need.</p>
        <p class="indent">Let&#8217;s look at a couple of examples to see how this works.</p>
        <p class="blockquote1">All,</p>
        <p class="blockquote">Just a reminder that next Thursday&#8217;s training session is mandatory. Everyone in the
            group needs to complete diversity training for compliance purposes.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">If you haven&#8217;t done the diversity training module during the <span
                epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_69"></span>last twelve months, you need to do it this time. Everyone has
            to complete the training by the end of May, or it could affect our licensing.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">We&#8217;ve got two more slots with the vendor. Please ensure you make it to one of
            the two upcoming sessions. If you know you cannot make it, let me know now.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Thanks,</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Mona</p>
        <p class="indent1">You can tell that Mona is concerned about making sure everyone gets this training and that
            she&#8217;s worried about what will happen if people miss it. She&#8217;s also worried that people are going
            to blow it off. She&#8217;s so worried about these issues, she&#8217;s forgotten to provide helpful
            information about when and where the training will take place. First she mentions &#8220;next
            Thursday,&#8221; then she refers to &#8220;two more slots with the vendor,&#8221; and the overall effect is
            confusing.</p>
        <p class="indent">Mona takes a step back and thinks about what her readers really need, what&#8217;s at stake,
            and how to communicate it best. She realizes that she needs to add those dates.</p>
        <p class="blockquote1">All,</p>
        <p class="blockquote">To renew our licensing, everyone in the group must complete the diversity training module
            by May 31. If you haven&#8217;t yet, you have two more chances:</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">February 11: 2&#8211;3 p.m.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">March 27: 10&#8211;11 a.m.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">If you don&#8217;t remember the last time you did this training, let me know and I
            will confirm. If you absolutely can&#8217;t make either of these times, let me know immediately. This has to
            get done.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Thank you!</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Mona</p>
        <p class="indent1">Reviewing your draft for content often helps you improve it in other ways as well. Mona has
            added the new information her readers need&#8212;the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_70"></span>dates
            of the training sessions&#8212;and in the process of thinking it through, she&#8217;s also managed to cut
            down the overall length of the message. Moreover, she has brought the issue of licensing to the very
            beginning of the message, letting her readers know what&#8217;s at stake right away.</p>
        <p class="indent">Including too much information can be as problematic as including too little. We often include
            too much because we&#8217;re more focused on ourselves than on our reader. A quick review of a draft can
            help tighten up the communication.</p>
        <p class="indent">Alec works for a regional bank that&#8217;s about to launch a new customer service initiative
            that will include getting more customers into the Elite Checking program. Currently branch personnel are
            offering customers Standard Checking as a default. As a result, customers who qualify for the better account
            are missing out on rewards, and some are paying unnecessary fees. Alec drafts a memo to branch tellers and
            other personnel introducing the new initiative. Here&#8217;s his first draft:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1">Hello MaxxBank AllStars!</p>
        <p class="blockquote">I&#8217;m writing today to announce an exciting new initiative for MaxxBank: the EliteStar
            program. As part of the initiative, we have a goal to bring 20 percent more new customers into Elite
            Checking accounts, and to move 20 percent of existing customers from Standard Checking into Elite.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Based on research throughout the region, we estimate that currently about 30 percent
            of existing customers in Standard in fact qualify for Elite based on their running daily balances. And about
            25 percent of new customers are placed into Standard Checking when they would be better served by Elite
            Checking. The result is that many of our customers are being underserved and missing out on the benefits
            that Elite offers. These customers often incur service charges that they would not be subject to if they had
            Elite status. We are managing a large volume of complaints across the branches as a result. We estimate that
            by moving qualified customers to Elite status, we can reduce fee-related complaints by as much as 35
            percent. And the revenue <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_71"></span>from the lost fees could be offset
            through happier customers engaging with the bank in other ways, say, through credit cards, home loans,
            mortgages, or other products.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Over the next few weeks, we&#8217;ll be rolling out training to make it easier for
            branch personnel to recognize potential Elite customers and help them have conversations to invite customers
            into the program. Keep your eyes open for more communication about this exciting initiative!</p>
        <p class="indent1">Alec puts his draft aside and comes back to review it the next day. Reading it over, he
            realizes that the content in the middle paragraph was on his mind because of a meeting he&#8217;d attended
            that day, but it really isn&#8217;t helpful to his readers. It makes the memo too long and tedious to read.
            In fact, some of that content&#8212;the section about making up lost revenue&#8212;he would prefer <span
                class="italic">not</span> to share with the branch personnel, because he doesn&#8217;t want to risk
            their passing it on to customers. That&#8217;s information for internal consumption only. He does want to
            provide some explanation for the initiative, though, because people perform better when they understand why
            they&#8217;re doing what they&#8217;re doing.</p>
        <p class="indent">Here&#8217;s Alec&#8217;s second draft:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1">Hello MaxxBank AllStars!</p>

            Checking accounts, and to move 20 percent of existing customers from Standard Checking into Elite.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Research shows that many of our Standard customers qualify for Elite status, and
            they&#8217;re missing out on the great rewards they could be enjoying, including free checks, overdraft
            protection, and interest on their balance. We want to ensure that these customers get the most from their
            MaxxBank relationship!</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Over the next few weeks, we&#8217;ll be rolling out the EliteStar <span
                epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_72"></span>training to help you identify potential Elite customers and
            bring them into the right account for them. Keep your eyes open for more communication about this exciting
            initiative!</p>
        <p class="indent1">In his revision, Alec removes the figures and some of the detailed rationale from the middle
            paragraph, and instead writes a middle paragraph with a clear message that will resonate with his readers:
            we&#8217;re launching this initiative to make sure that customers are having the best possible experience
            with MaxxBank. In this case, less content makes for a more effective communication.</p>

                <h3 class="heada"><span class="bold">Use Structure to Help You Choose Your Content</span></h3>
                <p class="noindent1s-n">Not everyone likes to use outlines when they write. If you&#8217;re writing
                    something very short and straightforward, an outline might be unnecessary. But sometimes with a
                    longer document, structuring your message with a quick outline can help you make sure your content
                    is complete and you&#8217;re presenting it in a logical way. The outline doesn&#8217;t have to be
                    complex; it can be a list of topics, which you then arrange in the order in which you want to
                    present them.</p>
                <p class="indents-n">You can even outline after you&#8217;ve written a draft, to check whether
                    you&#8217;re including the appropriate information&#8212;and nothing extraneous. Outlining after the
                    fact is called &#8220;reverse outlining.&#8221; Let&#8217;s look at reverse outlines of the two

        <h2 class="h2">How to Get the Content Right</h2>
        <p class="noindent1">If you like to <span class="bold">plan</span> before you write, you should think about your
            content in light of the work you did for Step 1, <span class="italic">Get the ask clear</span>, and Step 2,
            <span class="italic">Write for your reader</span>. Ask yourself these questions:</p>
        <p class="hang1a"><span class="italic">What content</span> must <span class="italic">I include to achieve my
                purpose in writing?</span></p>
        <p class="hang1"><span class="italic">What content does my reader</span> need<span class="italic">?</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">If you&#8217;re the kind of writer who likes to create a first draft and then <span

                epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_74"></span>process. Including extraneous content often comes from the
            writing equivalent of &#8220;thinking out loud&#8221;&#8212;mulling over or reviewing content in your own
            mind without considering if your audience needs it. Sometimes it&#8217;s helpful to your thought process to
            write everything out. But if the content isn&#8217;t useful to your reader, you should go back and cut it
            out. If you&#8217;ve already got a draft, take a quick pass over your document. Look at your pieces of
            information one at a time and run through a mental checklist:</p>
        <p class="hang1a"><span class="italic">Is this all the information my reader needs?</span></p>

            convoluted language. Modern-day corporate-speak comes from a variety of sources outside the business world:
            from the military, from sports, and from law, among other fields, often driven by the latest trends in
            management thinking. As businesspeople became more interested in warfare analogies, the habit of using
            military-style acronyms and specialized vocabulary grew. As businesspeople began to envision themselves as
            athletes, sports metaphors crept in. And because there&#8217;s always been a close connection between
            business and the law, some of the worst tendencies in business English come from aping legal
            writing&#8212;trying to sound authoritative and official, and muddying the meaning in the process.</p>
        <p class="indent">The pushback against these tendencies started in the 1970s. The plain English movement arose
            in response to the ridiculously obscure legalistic writing in government documents. In 1977, New York State
            passed laws requiring plain English in consumer contracts and leases. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter issued
            two executive orders mandating that government regulations be easy to understand. There is similar
            legislation across the English-speaking world.</p>
        <p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_76"></span>There are no laws against muddy, convoluted,
            jargon-ridden business writing, so it&#8217;s up to us to fix it on our own. The good news is that you can
            distinguish yourself by saying what you mean in plain English.</p>
        <h2 class="h2">Jargon</h2>
        <p class="noindent1">There are two kinds of jargon. One is the language specific to your business or industry:
            acronyms, abbreviations, and specialty vocabulary used as a shortcut among people who understand it:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n"><span class="italic">Will the ASB be ready in time for SteerCo? If not, I suggest we
                prioritize the alpha of ITB so the team can review it prior to the launch of ELF.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">Almost everyone who has a job has written this way at one time or another, and most of the
            time it&#8217;s perfectly fine. Sometimes, though, it&#8217;s not. When you use heavy jargon outside your
            immediate work &#173;circle&#8212;among people who don&#8217;t understand it&#8212;it can create a barrier
            to understanding. It can be a particular problem in proposals, where it can confuse, annoy, and alienate
            readers.</p>
        <p class="indent">The other kind of jargon is that common group of business buzzwords and clich&#233;s that many
            of us desperately overuse (<span class="italic">moving the needle, circling back, drilling down</span>, and
            so forth). Using this kind of jargon excessively, even when your audience will understand it, can flatten
            your writing and diminish its impact. Relying too much on jargon can make you sound sloppy, as if
            you&#8217;re not willing to do the work to express what you mean accurately.</p>

        <p class="extract">Upskill</p>
        <p class="extract">Value add</p>
        <p class="extract">Warning shot</p>
        <p class="indent1">I&#8217;m sure you could add to the list. Such phrases are often metaphors, as you can see,
            and taken in bulk they&#8217;re just comical. Things really get interesting when writers begin to mix these
            metaphors; the result is often pure nonsense:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n"><span class="italic">Have you noticed that the farther you move toward fulfilling your
                potential, the higher the needle moves forward?</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">Wait, which way is the needle moving? Up or forward? It&#8217;s a silly example, but it came
            from a real document, and it illustrates what happens when people rely on these expressions too much: they
            stop thinking. Consider how distinctive and refreshing your voice as a writer could be if you cut down on
            your use of this kind of jargon.</p>
        <p class="noindent1s-n">Instead of</p>
        <p class="blockquotec"><span class="italic">Going forward, we should drill down into actionable initiatives
                rather than blue-sky thinking.</span></p>

        <p class="blockquotec"><span class="italic">In the future, we should focus on initiatives that we can actually
                implement rather than unproven ideas.</span></p>
        <p class="noindent1s-n"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_78"></span>Instead of</p>
        <p class="blockquotec"><span class="italic">At the end of the day, we can advance by targeting quick wins and
                low-hanging fruit in the market.</span></p>

        <p class="blockquotec"><span class="italic">Ultimately, we&#8217;ll succeed if we focus on easily achievable
                goals.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">You&#8217;ll note that both of these examples do more than eliminate offending phrases. The
            revisions are more specific and easier to understand than the originals. They present concrete ideas that
            can be discussed and perhaps disagreed with. Do we really want to stick with what we already know how to do,
            without exploring other avenues? Is focusing on easy goals really the right thing to do now? When you strip
            these suggestions of their jargon, it becomes much easier to understand and discuss them.</p>

        <h2 class="h2">Needlessly Complicated Language</h2>
        <p class="noindent1">In Step 4, <span class="italic">Be concise</span>, we looked at the bad habit of using long
            phrases where short ones would do. In that step, we were concerned about saving space and writing
            economically. Here we&#8217;re concerned with a different issue: how using language that&#8217;s needlessly
            complicated can instead impinge on your ability to communicate.</p>
        <p class="indent">What do I mean by &#8220;needlessly complicated&#8221; language? Here are some examples:</p>
        <p class="extract1">Utilize = use</p>
        <p class="extract">Initiate = start</p>
        <p class="extract">Subsequent to = after</p>
        <p class="extract">Prior to = before</p>
        <p class="extract">In light of the fact that = because or since</p>
        <p class="extract">In the event that = if</p>
        <p class="extract">In close proximity = near</p>
        <p class="extract">In the near future = soon</p>
        <p class="extract">With reference to = about</p>
        <p class="extract">With regard to = about</p>
        <p class="extract">Regarding = about</p>
        <p class="extract">At this time = now</p>
        <p class="extract">At this point in time = now</p>
        <p class="extract">By means of = by</p>
        <p class="extract">In accordance with = under, by</p>
        <p class="extract">In order to = to</p>
        <p class="extract">In the absence of = without</p>
        <p class="extract">In cases when = when</p>
        <p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_79"></span>The basic pattern here is taking a small,
            simple word and replacing it with a bigger word or a series of words. Just as with jargon, the impulse
            behind this kind of writing seems to be that it will make you look smarter or more serious or more
            professional. Why merely <span class="italic">begin</span> something when you can <span
                class="italic">initiate</span> it? Why <span class="italic">use</span> a thing when you can <span
                class="italic">utilize</span> it?</p>
        <p class="indent">You&#8217;ll notice that a lot of these forms are prepositional phrases, which we discussed in
            Step 4, <span class="italic">Be concise</span>. Learning to recognize them is a useful tool in improving
            your writing skills.</p>
        <p class="indent">This kind of deliberate complication is everywhere in business. It has seeped into customer
            service training. Cashiers in some stores have stopped calling for the &#8220;next&#8221; customer and
            started saying &#8220;following&#8221; instead, as if adding those syllables demonstrates superior customer
            service.</p>
        <p class="indent">Of course, stores are not fooling customers about the quality of their service simply by
            having associates say &#8220;following&#8221; rather than &#8220;next.&#8221; By the same token,
            you&#8217;re not fooling anyone when you use needlessly complicated language in your writing. In fact,
            you&#8217;ll impress people more if your writing is straightforward and clear. Let&#8217;s look at some
            examples:</p>
        <p class="noindent1s-n">Instead of</p>
        <p class="blockquotec"><span class="italic">In the absence of relevant performance data, we are unable to make

        <p class="blockquotec"><span class="italic">Without performance data, we cannot recommend alternative

        <p class="blockquotec"><span class="italic">Right now, we don&#8217;t have enough desks for everyone to come
                into the office every day.</span></p>
        <h2 class="h2">But Everybody Writes This Way</h2>
        <p class="noindent1">You might be wondering what the big deal is. Lots of people write this way&#8212;business
            writing just sounds like this. If everyone writes this way, then everyone will understand you, right? So
            what&#8217;s the problem?</p>
        <p class="indent">There are two problems, in fact. The first is that not everyone <span
                class="italic">will</span> understand you. It&#8217;s possible to get your head so deeply into jargon
            and convoluted language that you&#8217;re actually hard to understand. Look at this sentence, for example:
        </p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n"><span class="italic">A strong risk identification process casts a broad net that
                captures all key risks and then drills down within the major risks to understand root causes.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">What?</p>
        <p class="indent">Unless you&#8217;re a risk consultant, you have to squint at this sentence pretty hard to
            understand what it&#8217;s trying to say, which is this:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1-n"><span class="italic">A strong risk identification process helps you understand the key
                risks and their causes.</span></p>
        <p class="indent1">This &#8220;translation&#8221; might be too informal, but it captures the meaning of the
            original in much clearer terms.</p>
        <p class="indent">The second problem with this kind of writing is that it can make you look bad. Ironically,
            most people start writing this way to sound smart. Then it takes over their brains. I&#8217;ve always felt
            that this habit <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_81"></span>made people look dumber, not smarter. It
            turns out I&#8217;m not the only one who feels this way, and there&#8217;s research to support this
            conclusion. Carnegie Mellon psychologist Daniel Oppenheimer, in a paper called &#8220;Consequences of
            Erudite Vernacular Utilized Irrespective of Necessity: Problems with Using Long Words Needlessly,&#8221;
            found that writers who use long words unnecessarily are perceived by readers as less intelligent than those
            who use simpler vocabulary.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" id="fn-3"
                    href="12_Chapter03.xhtml#fn_3">&#8727;</a></sup> In accepting the 2006 Ig Nobel Prize for
            Literature, Professor Oppenheimer explained, &#8220;It&#8217;s important to point out that this research is
            not about problems with using long words but about using long words needlessly.&#8221; He concluded:
            &#8220;One thing seems certain: write as simply and plainly as possible and it&#8217;s more likely
            you&#8217;ll be thought of as intelligent.&#8221;<sup><a epub:type="noteref" id="fn-4"
                    href="12_Chapter03.xhtml#fn_4">&#8224;</a></sup></p>
        <p class="indent">Furthermore, I suspect that writing this way does more than make you <span
                class="italic">sound</span> dumb. I think it <span class="italic">makes</span> you dumber. I don&#8217;t
            have any research to support this idea, but it seems to me that if you have a limited vocabulary, your
            thinking will be limited. If you have only a small set of ideas that your brain defaults to, can you really
            be &#8220;thinking outside the box&#8221;? I suppose it might happen the same way that relying on a GPS can
            short-circuit your sense of direction and prevent you from using your natural navigation skills. By
            accepting the challenge to write clearly, you&#8217;ll challenge yourself to do better thinking.</p>
        <p class="indent">When everyone else communicates this way, it&#8217;s natural that you may want to fit in. Of
            course, there&#8217;s vocabulary in any line of business, but there&#8217;s also a voice, and we
            unconsciously adopt that voice. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with fitting in; what&#8217;s wrong is the
            &#8220;unconscious&#8221; part. So you fit in, and then eventually you sound like everyone else. But once
            you have some confidence, you might find the courage to start sounding like yourself. You will stand out in
            the organization if you have a distinctive and clear voice. It will be an asset to you. People will <span
                epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_82"></span>see that your writing is clear and figure that your thinking
            must be clear, too. You don&#8217;t have to write in businessese to sound smart. You&#8217;ll sound even
            smarter if you can get rid of the jargon and the inflated language and write in a clear and direct voice.

                <h3 class="heada"><span class="bold">Your Favorite Buzzwords</span></h3>
                <p class="noindent1s-n">Everyone has favorite things: foods, clothing, movies . . . and language. You
                    might find that you have particular buzzwords you use over and over again. I had a client once who
                    couldn&#8217;t get through the morning without calling something &#8220;foundational.&#8221; He
                    seemed to be completely unaware of how frequently he was leaning on the word.</p>
                <p class="indents-n">What&#8217;s the harm? For one thing, people notice it when you overuse buzzwords,
                    and they will notice if there&#8217;s one you tend to use repeatedly. For another thing, relying too
                    much on one word can shape the way you think. A shortcut in communication can reflect a shortcut in
                    thinking. When you default to repeating certain words, your vocabulary shrinks, and so does the way
                    you perceive the world. Was everything my client noted really &#8220;foundational&#8221;? Sometimes
                    he used the word to mean &#8220;seminal&#8221; (which is close to its actual meaning), sometimes to
                    mean &#8220;original,&#8221; and sometimes to mean &#8220;important.&#8221; His overuse of the word
                    had blurred the distinctions among the different meanings he ascribed to it, and his thinking, in
                    this area at least, had become a little sloppy.</p>
                <p class="indents-n">Is there a word you overuse? It&#8217;s worthwhile noticing if you&#8217;ve
                    developed an unconscious habit of depending too much on the same word. Breaking the habit can help
                    you break into more specific and creative thinking patterns.</p>

        <h2 class="h2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_83"></span>How to Write in Plain English</h2>
        <p class="noindent1">Breaking the habit of writing in businessese can be difficult. If you&#8217;re a <span
                class="bold">planner</span> and like to outline your messages and documents before you start writing,
            you can use a trick that will make it easy for you to draft in plain English right from the start: explain
            the concept to your grandmother. This trick is very helpful in overcoming writer&#8217;s block (see <a
                target="_blank" href="16_Chapter07.xhtml#page_188">here</a>), and it&#8217;s also helpful when you want
            to express yourself in clear language. Your grandmother probably doesn&#8217;t know what moving the needle
            means, and she&#8217;ll probably laugh at you if you say you&#8217;re going to initiate something rather
            than start it. Use your grandmother as a model audience to figure out how to say what you mean directly and
            without jargon.</p>
        <p class="indent">If you&#8217;re an <span class="bold">editor</span> and like to revise your drafts, you can
            also enlist the help of your grandmother. As you read what you&#8217;ve written, imagine that she&#8217;s
            sitting next to you. Is there junk in your draft that would make her raise her eyebrows or shake her head?
            Get rid of it, and replace it with plain English.</p>
        <p class="indent">Obviously you don&#8217;t have to use your grandmother as this model reader&#8212;she&#8217;s
            just a good example of someone who&#8217;s probably intelligent and not overly impressed with fancy
            language. She&#8217;s sympathetic to you and cares what you have to say, but she wants to understand it. You
            can choose any model reader you like&#8212;anyone who will help you get a different perspective on your
            writing, so that you can write more clearly.</p>
        <div class="box2">
            <div class="box3">
                <h3 class="heada"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_84"></span><span class="bold">Beware of Revision
                        Fatigue</span></h3>
                <p class="noindent1s-n">Every time you revise, you create the potential for new errors, and revising
                    onscreen can increase this risk. Especially if you&#8217;re working in a rush, it&#8217;s easy to
                    leave careless errors in your document. These are often the product of partial revisions:</p>
                <p class="blockquote1-n"><span class="italic">I will be in the London next week.</span></p>
                <p class="indent1s-n">This writer initially wrote, &#8220;I will be in the U.K. next week,&#8221; then
                    decided to be more specific and say &#8220;London&#8221; instead. But she forgot to remove
                    &#8220;the,&#8221; and so ended up with this weird hybrid form.</p>
                <p class="indents-n">Using tracked changes creates another risk: you might have a document so full of
                    changes that you literally can&#8217;t see what the final version will look like through all the
                    strikethroughs and different colors of additions. So when you accept changes, you might
                    inadvertently end up with something like this:</p>
                <p class="blockquote1-n"><span class="italic">Tom Stevens and Karen Washington will lead consolidation
                        efforts in the Midwest and regional strategy leadership and provide leadership in strategy in
                        the region.</span></p>
                <p class="indent1s-n">With tracked changes showing, that revision looked fine, but with the changes
                    accepted, it&#8217;s clear that the actual editing wasn&#8217;t quite finished.</p>
                <p class="indents-n">Revision&#8212;especially when you go through many &#173;iterations&#8212;can cause
                    fatigue and lead to errors. No matter how sick and tired your intensive work on the project has
                    <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_85"></span>made you feel, be sure to go through your draft one
                    last time before you finalize it to catch all the weird little errors that might have crept in. If
                    you&#8217;ve been through so many revisions that you feel you can&#8217;t &#8220;see&#8221; the
                    document anymore, ask a colleague to take a quick pass through and clean up any clutter left behind.

        <p class="epi"><span class="italic">&#8220;So much aggravation and time-wasting could be avoided if people would
                just stop and think before they hit Send&#8221;.</span></p>
        <p class="epi-r">&#8212;S<span class="small">URVEY RESPONDENT</span></p>
        <p class="noindent1">Ever finish a writing task and feel like there&#8217;s something wrong? It could be an
            e-mail, or it could be something longer, like a proposal. It&#8217;s not a great feeling, but it&#8217;s
            also not uncommon. Most people who have this apprehension will struggle a little bit, maybe glance over
            their writing, fight back the feeling, and send the thing anyway. I&#8217;m going to suggest that you do not
            do that&#8212;that instead you spend a little more time figuring out what&#8217;s bugging you and fix it,
            rather than sending something you&#8217;re not confident about.</p>
        <p class="indent">How? Let&#8217;s look at a quick method for checking over your writing.</p>
        <p class="indent">First, run through Steps 1&#8211;6 quickly.</p>
        <p class="extract2"><span class="bolditalic">Step 1:</span> Get the ask clear</p>
        <p class="extracta"><span class="bolditalic">Step 2:</span> Write for your reader</p>
        <p class="extracta"><span class="bolditalic">Step 3:</span> Start strong and specific</p>
        <p class="extracta"><span class="bolditalic">Step 4:</span> Be concise</p>
        <p class="extracta"><span class="bolditalic">Step 5:</span> Fill in missing content; delete extraneous content
        </p>
        <p class="extracta"><span class="bolditalic">Step 6:</span> Write in plain English</p>
        <p class="indent1">Look especially closely at Steps 1 and 2&#8212;they&#8217;re harder than they seem, and
            sometimes some extra attention to refining your purpose and writing for your reader will solve whatever
            problem you&#8217;re facing. Step 5, <span class="italic">Fill in missing content; delete extraneous
                content</span>, is also worth special consideration. It&#8217;s common to have afterthoughts about the
            information you&#8217;re including. Have you said too much or too little?</p>
        <p class="indent">What else might be bothering you?</p>
        <h2 class="h2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_87"></span>Confidentiality</h2>
        <p class="noindent1">Maybe you&#8217;re getting that nagging feeling because you&#8217;re putting something in
            writing that you shouldn&#8217;t. Are you including something that could make you or your company look bad?
            What if the content of your message or document became public? If that idea bothers you, you should probably
            revise what you&#8217;ve written.</p>
        <h2 class="h2">Commitment</h2>
        <p class="noindent1">Are you overpromising? Are you committing to something you&#8217;re not sure you can
            deliver? If you&#8217;re making a commitment you&#8217;re not sure you can meet, you should probably revise
            your message.</p>
        <h2 class="h2">Politics</h2>
        <p class="noindent1">Does your document or message contain something that&#8217;s politically unwise? Are you
            oversharing, about either yourself or someone else? Are you blaming someone when you shouldn&#8217;t be? Are
            you aligning with someone you shouldn&#8217;t or failing to align with someone you should? Political issues
            at work can be quite delicate, and if you&#8217;ve rushed through your writing, you might not have hit the
            right note the first time through. Take some time to consider your position and perhaps revise it.</p>
        <h2 class="h2">Punctuation</h2>
        <p class="noindent1">Don&#8217;t laugh. Who remembers the rules for comma usage? No one, that&#8217;s who. Most
            of us have forgotten punctuation rules, if we ever learned them in the first place, and worries about
            punctuation can make otherwise good writers feel insecure about their writing. There&#8217;s a very easy
            remedy for this: review the rules and be sure you&#8217;re using punctuation correctly. Refer to the
            &#8220;Punctuation&#8221; section at the back of this book (starting <a target="_blank"
                href="16_Chapter07.xhtml#page_219">here</a>) as often as you need to. &#173;Answering <span
                epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_88"></span>your punctuation questions can boost your confidence as a
            writer. Don&#8217;t let punctuation bring you down.</p>
        <h2 class="h2">Laziness</h2>
        <p class="noindent1">Laziness strikes even the most conscientious writers from time to time. Possible signs of
            laziness in your writing include lack of clarity and poor logical connections. Don&#8217;t worry&#8212;this
            is precisely why we break the writing process into steps and work with drafts: to enable you to catch
            problems before you send them out into the world. Go back and put in a little extra effort to ensure that
            what you&#8217;re sending is clear and complete.</p>
        <h2 class="h2">Tone</h2>
        <p class="noindent1">Often when we feel that our writing &#8220;just doesn&#8217;t sound right,&#8221; the
            problem lies with the tone of what we&#8217;ve written. Most good everyday business writing uses a tone
            that&#8217;s friendly and professional.</p>
        <p class="indent">It&#8217;s not always easy to get your tone right the first time. Two things, in particular,
            to consider are:</p>
        <p class="indents-n1">Your relationship with the reader</p>
        <p class="indents-n">The importance of the topic (which includes what&#8217;s at stake)</p>
        <p class="indent1">Checking your draft against these two points can help you correct an inappropriate tone.</p>
        <p class="indent">The tone of business communication in most organizations is pretty casual, but not as casual
            as a personal chat. Check to make sure that what you&#8217;ve written is appropriate for work&#8212;no
            texting abbreviations, no super-casual expressions. (For more on tone, see &#8220;Does This Sound
            Okay?&#8221; <a target="_blank" href="12_Chapter03.xhtml#page_92">here</a>.)</p>
        <p class="indent">So, as you can see, there might be a number of causes behind that nagging feeling that
            there&#8217;s something wrong with your draft. Let&#8217;s <span epub:type="pagebreak"
                id="page_89"></span>consider some examples of messages that could be improved by one last review before
            they&#8217;re sent out.</p>
        <p class="blockquote1">Hi Terri,</p>
        <p class="blockquote">Would you mind sharing the Arris opening/closing titles used for the Arris conference as a
            .mov file with me? We have a couple more videos that popped up, and we&#8217;re planning to handle these
            edits internally. Also, can you point me to a finished video as a model of the style we&#8217;re looking
            for? I&#8217;m taking over from Sean on this project.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">BTW, the Walls files are now in the final folder on Dropbox.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Thanks,</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Jared</p>
        <p class="indent1">Writing to Terri about Arris has reminded Jared that he also wanted to share the Walls files
            with her, so he drops in that information at the end of this message. This kind of last-minute addition is
            very common, and it&#8217;s also very common for readers to overlook these afterthoughts. Mentioning an
            unrelated topic at the end of an e-mail on another subject creates a significant risk that the reader
            won&#8217;t see it. It also makes it harder to organize and search e-mails by subject if the reader should
            want to go back later. In this case, it&#8217;s better for Jared to send Terri a separate message about the
            Walls files.</p>
        <p class="indent">Here&#8217;s one that&#8217;s trickier:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1">Dear Ming,</p>
        <p class="blockquote">Please feel free to reach out to me directly if anything else comes up. David and Jon
            hadn&#8217;t finished the analysis when they handed off the project to us, so David just had to contact me
            when you wrote to him yesterday. Amy and I tracked down the information you needed. There are likely other
            gaps, so please don&#8217;t hesitate to contact me directly.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Best,</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Brandon</p>
        <p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_90"></span>Brandon&#8217;s tone sounds a little snarky,
            and this first draft isn&#8217;t as politically astute as it might be. Brandon is trying to tell Ming that
            David and Jon didn&#8217;t finish the work, that he and Amy had to clear up their unfinished mess, and that
            she should not write to David for this information in the future. He&#8217;s not happy about what happened,
            and he&#8217;d like to let Ming know that. However, when he reviews his draft, he realizes that he&#8217;s
            throwing David and Jon under the bus and sounds passive-aggressive. He&#8217;s uncomfortable with the first
            draft, so he revises it.</p>
        <p class="blockquote1">Dear Ming,</p>
        <p class="blockquote">Please feel free to reach out to me directly if anything else comes up. I spoke with Amy
            yesterday while we were tracking down the information, and we both feel there might be other gaps. I&#8217;d
            be happy to find anything else you need.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Best,</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Brandon</p>
        <p class="noindent1">Brandon&#8217;s revision gets the message across&#8212;that he and Amy did the work to find
            what Ming was looking for, that the project was not in fact completed, and that Brandon is the owner
            now&#8212;without explicitly blaming David and Jon. Brandon closes on a note of goodwill.</p>
        <p class="indent">Here&#8217;s one more first draft that felt wrong:</p>
        <p class="blockquote1">Alison,</p>
        <p class="blockquote">Thanks for your message. We should be able to get those units out to your customer by June
            2. I&#8217;ll stay in touch.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Maria</p>
        <p class="indent1">Maria reviews her draft and feels a little worried. She realizes she&#8217;s being vague and
            that she&#8217;s not sharing with Alison what&#8217;s really on her mind. She also realizes that her
            vagueness could lead to problems in the future, so she revises her message.</p>
        <p class="blockquote1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_91"></span>Alison,</p>
        <p class="blockquote">Thanks for your message. I&#8217;ll try my best to get those units out to your customer by
            June 2. However, we have two very large orders in the queue ahead of this request, so I am not sure we can
            deliver that quickly. Would your customer accept half the quantity by that date and the other half two weeks
            later? Let&#8217;s talk about how to get this done. Please call me.</p>
        <p class="blockquote-ind">Maria</p>
        <p class="noindent1">In her revision, Maria avoids the temptation to push the issue off her plate and explains
            what&#8217;s worrying her. She briefly lays out the reason she might not be able to fulfill Alison&#8217;s
            request and invites Alison to do some creative problem-solving with her.</p>
        <h2 class="h2">Ask a Colleague for Input</h2>

            you don&#8217;t mind sharing, ask a colleague to have a quick look at your draft. Whenever you ask someone
            for feedback on your writing, you&#8217;ll get better results if you direct their attention to areas that
            concern you. It&#8217;s fine if your question is simply &#8220;There&#8217;s something bothering me about
            this draft; does it look okay to you?&#8221; But if you ask specific questions, you&#8217;ll get more
            focused feedback. Try &#8220;Am I leaving out anything?&#8221; or &#8220;Am I approaching this right?&#8221;
            or &#8220;Am I saying too much?&#8221;</p>
        <p class="indent">It&#8217;s a great idea to find an informal proofreading and copyediting partner at work.
            You&#8217;ll learn not just from your partner&#8217;s comments on your writing, but also from looking
            closely at her work. You&#8217;ll both become better writers.</p>

                <p class="epi"><span class="italic">&#8220;Expressing the right tone is critical to avoid
                        misunderstandings, without the benefit of facial expressions and body language.&#8221;</span>
                </p>

                <p class="noindent1s-n">Often when a piece of writing &#8220;just sounds wrong,&#8221; there&#8217;s a
                    problem with tone. &#8220;Tone&#8221; in writing is like tone of voice. Your tone reflects your
                    attitude toward the reader and toward the topic you&#8217;re writing about. Your tone might be
                    friendly, cordial, respectful, deferential, playful, abrupt, rude, or anything in between.</p>
                <p class="indents-n">In business writing, appropriate tone can range from very informal&#8212;think of
                    the website of an online grocery-&#173;delivery service&#8212;to very formal, such as communication
                    from a bank. Most companies have adopted a tone that reflects their brand and their values, for both
                    external and internal communication. The tone used in external communications&#8212;advertising,
                    websites, messages to customers&#8212;will usually be the product of conscious, brand-driven
                    decision-making. The tone used for internal communications usually develops more organically, with
                    people emulating the style they see others using.</p>
                <p class="indents-n">Several elements contribute to the tone of your writing. One of these is word
                    choice: consider the different implications, for example, of &#8220;terrible,&#8221; &#8220;very
                    bad,&#8221; and &#8220;not ideal.&#8221; If your tone sounds harsh, you might want to replace some
                    of your vocabulary selections with softer options. Consider the different impressions made by
                    &#8220;awesome,&#8221; &#8220;successful,&#8221; and &#8220;impressive.&#8221; If your tone feels
                    too chatty, consider a more professional vocabulary.</p>
                <p class="indents-n"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_93"></span>Sentence length also shapes tone.
                    Short, choppy sentences can sound abrupt. Long, complex sentences can come across as impersonal.
                    Experiment until your writing sounds conversational but respectful.</p>
                <p class="indents-n">Here are a couple of ideas about how to change your tone easily:</p>
                <p class="lists1"><img src="../Images/common1.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />Take the focus
                    off the reader and put it on yourself: &#8220;You didn&#8217;t send the information&#8221; versus
                    &#8220;We haven&#8217;t received the information&#8221;</p>
                <p class="lists0"><img src="../Images/common1.jpg" alt="images" /><span class="space" />Consider whether
                    deleting or changing a word or two can change your tone:</p>
                <p class="extractd">&#8220;He still hasn&#8217;t finished the analysis&#8221; versus &#8220;He
                    hasn&#8217;t finished the analysis&#8221;</p>
                <p class="extractd">(The word &#8220;still&#8221; can suggest that he&#8217;s missed a deadline or imply
                    that he&#8217;s a slacker.)</p>
                <p class="extractd">&#8220;We expect to receive . . .&#8221; versus &#8220;We&#8217;re looking forward
                    to receiving . . .&#8221;</p>
                <p class="extractd">(&#8220;We expect&#8221; sounds dictatorial; &#8220;we&#8217;re looking forward
                    to&#8221; sounds warm.)</p>
                <p class="indent1s-n-l">It can be difficult to recognize the tone of your own writing. But if
                    you&#8217;re worried that your tone might not be appropriate, you might be right. If you&#8217;re
                    not sure you&#8217;re hitting the right tone, ask a colleague to read over your draft and give you
                    feedback on how it sounds.</p>

                        Company&#8217;s Style Guide</span></h3>
                <p class="noindent1s-n">Many organizations that take written communication seriously have developed
                    style guides for their employees to use. These guides vary a lot in length and scope, but the
                    overall goal of all of them is to help ensure that everyone in the organization is communicating
                    consistently.</p>
                <p class="indents-n">Style guides serve a number of purposes. Like visual style guides, which specify
                    the fonts, colors, and logos used in visual materials, written style guides can help keep an
                    organization&#8217;s branding consistent.</p>
                <p class="indents-n">Style guides usually contain directions specific to your company. For instance, is
                    it ever acceptable to abbreviate the name of the company in written correspondence, or should you
                    always spell out its full name? What are the appropriate titles to use for people? Should those
                    titles be capitalized? What are the correct names for products and services? How do you refer to the
                    people who buy your products and services&#8212;are they &#8220;clients&#8221; or
                    &#8220;customers&#8221;? Can you ever abbreviate clients&#8217; names in writing? This kind of
                    information is especially important in situations where your company&#8217;s public identity is in
                    flux, such as during a merger or a rebranding.</p>
                <p class="indents-n">Style guides also specify preferences in punctuation and spelling. Should you use
                    the Oxford comma or not? (See <a target="_blank" href="16_Chapter07.xhtml#page_219">here</a> for a
                    definition of the Oxford comma.) Is it &#8220;Internet&#8221; or &#8220;internet&#8221;? Guides can
                    also offer help with style issues&#8212;for instance, should you use &#8220;e.g.&#8221; or
                    &#8220;for example&#8221;?</p>
                <p class="indents-n">Some style guides also provide reminders about basic grammar and usage. For
                    example, when should you spell out numbers in text, and when is it okay to use numerals? When <span
                        epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_95"></span>do you use double quotation marks, and when do you use
                    single ones? How should you use a hyphen? These questions are especially important if your company
                    is global and different rules apply across the different countries where the company operates.</p>
                <p class="indents-n">It&#8217;s worthwhile finding out if your company has a style guide&#8212;and, if
                    it does, getting hold of it&#8212;when you&#8217;re trying to put the finishing touches on your
                    writing. Unless you&#8217;re an editor at heart, you probably won&#8217;t want to read your
                    organization&#8217;s style guide cover to cover, but you might find that it has the answer to that
                    little question that&#8217;s been bothering you. Using your company&#8217;s style guide can help
                    save you time and keep the brand voice consistent.</p>
