    <p class="blockquote">I wanted to follow up on our meeting earlier today regarding a possible partnership between
      MisMatch and Wine&amp;Dine. We have three advantages in working together. First, we are both new companies and
      need to test our concepts in the marketplace. Second, the services offered by each company are complementary.
      Third, New York is an expensive, if critical, market. By sharing the cost of a media campaign, we can reduce our
      individual cost, while hopefully increasing our membership numbers. Clearly, there are further opportunities to
      work as partners once we assess the success of this program.</p>

    <h2 class="h2">Get Your Content Right</h2>
    <p class="noindent">There&#8217;s a strong impulse when you&#8217;re preparing your slides to include too much
      content. Research has shown that people typically remember only four slides from a twenty-page deck.<sup><a
          epub:type="noteref" id="fn-6" href="15_Chapter06.xhtml#fn_6">"&#8727;</a></sup> That&#8217;s not very
      encouraging news if you&#8217;re putting your heart and soul into an informative presentation, but from a
      strategic point of view, it&#8217;s good to know. Rather than packing your presentation full of facts,
      you&#8217;re better off choosing a few key points you want your audience to remember, and organizing the
      presentation around those. Think of your PowerPoint deck as a set <span epub:type="pagebreak"
        id="page_122"></span>of prompts for your performance rather than as a repository for complete
      information.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" id="fn-7" href="15_Chapter06.xhtml#fn_7">&#8224;</a></sup></p>


    <!--<div class="anno-right">
              <p class="anno">Of course, there are different uses for PowerPoint. Some consulting organizations, for example, use PowerPoint decks to convey extensive data and recommendations to their clients, rather than as frameworks for oral presentations. In this section, I&#8217;m assuming you are using PowerPoint as a basis for a spoken presentation.</p>
            </div>    {{tooltip}}-->

    <p class="indent">Set up your slides as a visual aid for when you&#8217;re making a speech or presentation, not as a
      trove of data. When presented with a very text-heavy slide, people will typically space out or stop listening and
      read the slide (people can read faster than you can talk). If you want to provide detailed information to your
      audience, you can make and distribute a leave-behind deck that contains your entire talk. For the presentation
      itself, keep your slides concise and the focus on you.</p>


    <h2 class="h2">Case Study: 4F&amp;D, Inc.</h2>
    <p class="noindent">To put the information about proposals in context, we can consider a case study. 4F&amp;D, Inc.
      is a fictional company that operates a series of local food delivery services under the brand Fork Over: Fast and
      Free Food Delivery.</p>
    <p class="indent">Based in Chicago, Illinois, 4F&amp;D, Inc. was founded by Amy Owner in 2008. The company jumped
      into the crowded food-delivery field, where the main competitors were individual restaurants that hired their own
      delivery people to cover a specific territory. 4F&amp;D launched Fork Over: Fast and Free Food Delivery in the
      fall of 2009 serving 25 restaurants. 4F&amp;D provided client restaurants with both a technology system to
      facilitate online orders, including processing credit cards, and a third-party delivery service in exchange for a
      commission for each sale. While restaurants were skeptical at first, they also saw that they had little to lose.
      The commission was on sales that they would otherwise not have made. By 2010, the company had a network of more
      than 500 establishments across the city.</p>
    <p class="indent">As reaching neighborhoods further away from the city center became more difficult, Amy saw an
      opportunity to expand her business model to serve small communities that could not support high-volume trade. Fork
      Over launched a pilot program in Boise, Idaho, in 2013. To ascertain whether the new business model is viable,
      Amy&#8217;s team created a report on the short- and long-term prospects of the Boise Pilot program. Now Amy wants
      to explore the possibility of creating partnerships with local client restaurants as a precursor to obtaining
      venture capital funding for a regional and then national rollout of Fork Over: Fast and Free Food Delivery.</p>
    <p class="indent">The following is the executive summary from the team&#8217;s proposal.</p>
    <p class="nonindent<p clcontentote">
      <!-- {{tooltip_right}}The Statista data are used to demonstrate an opportunity rather than support a market claim.{{tooltip}}-->
      4F&amp;D is a successful company that works with local restaurants to increase sales, build customer loyalty and
      demand, and ensure timely food delivery. The food delivery and takeout industry represents a substantial portion
      of food sales annually. According to data from Statista, 60 percent of consumers in the United States ordered
      takeout or delivery at least once a week—only 2 percent said that they never ordered it at all. The study also
      found the following: </p>
    <p class="list">1.<span class="space" />Generally, men ordered more often than women.</p>
    <p class="list">2.<span class="space" />In 2013, pizza was the most popular type of food for takeout or delivery,
      with almost three quarters of consumers stating that they ordered it via the Internet or an app.</p>
    <p class="list">3.<span class="space" />In the same year, consumers spent more than US &#36;32 billion in the quick
      service pizza restaurant sector.</p>
    <p class="list">4.<span class="space" />Carry-out pizza made up US &#36;14.6 billion of this figure, and delivery
      pizza accounted for almost US &#36;10 billion.</p>
    <p class="list">5.<span class="space" />As of February 2014, Papa Murphy&#8217;s was the favorite pizza restaurant
      of more than two thirds of Americans, followed by Pizza Ranch and Papa John&#8217;s.</p>
    <p class="list">6.<span class="space" />Restaurant delivery and takeout is not just limited to pizza: Other popular
      foods include sandwiches, burgers, Chinese food, chicken wings, and Mexican food.</p>
    <p class="list">7.<span class="space" />A third of consumers stated that they revisit their most-frequented
      restaurant because of the availability of takeout.</p>
    <p class="blockquote">Statista Dossier. (2014, June). <span class="italic">Food delivery industry in the U.S.</span>
      http://www.statista.com/statistics/218712/takeout-or-delivery-spending-in-the-us/</p>
    <p class="blockquote">While many of these food establishments represent the traditional fare that consumers are used
      to ordering, such as pizza, Chinese, diner fare, and Mexican, the numbers also demonstrate that consumers are
      willing and ready to order online for delivery. The market is large, the profits are demonstrable, and the
      opportunity exists to push online ordering and food delivery in a new direction.</p>
    <p class="nonindent"><span class="bold">Solution</span></p>
    <p class="blockquote">
      <!-- {{tooltip_right}}A proposal is a forward-looking document that is by nature speculative. It is designed around a solution that does not yet exist. For this reason, the proposal highlights a problem that needs to be solved.{{tooltip}}-->
      4F&amp;D proposes to create a pilot operation with 10 restaurants in the Boise area that currently do not have
      delivery options. Working as partners, each party will agree to honor a radical departure from traditional online
      ordering and home delivery options. Keep in mind that 10 years ago people did not order food online, and today
      more than three quarters do. Markets move rapidly, and consumers are increasingly demanding what they want when
      they want it.</p>
    <p class="blockquote">The new service, A la Carte to Home, will allow customers to order single menu items from any
      of the participating restaurants at prices that offer a discount from the stated menu pricing. 4F&amp;D will
      install and absorb the cost for the technology ordering and payment system to be modified for taxes on A la Carte
      items. The consortium will contribute an equal pro-rated amount for a citywide marketing campaign.</p>
    <p class="blockquote">We further propose that A la Carte to Home be a model for additional expansion beyond Boise.
      The original participants will be given the opportunity to receive royalty payments as part of the partnership.
      The goal is to create a viable model that can be rolled out regionally and then nationally with venture capital
      funding. This pilot will serve as proof that the concept can work.</p>
    <p class="nonindent"><span class="bold">Qualifications</span></p>
    <p class="blockquote">
      <!-- {{tooltip_right}}Proposals are seeking some kind of investment, whether time, money, or resources. Therefore, the credibility of the proposers is very important. They must establish their qualifications to deliver on what they promise.{{tooltip}}-->
      Based in Chicago, Illinois, 4F&amp;D, Inc. was founded by Amy Owner in 2008. The company jumped into the crowded
      food-delivery field, where the main competitors were individual restaurants that hired their own delivery people
      to cover a specific territory. At times, restaurants sometimes pooled their deliveries with neighboring
      establishments. Amy realized that the market was ready for a new kind of service that could take advantage of
      cooperative deliveries by creating a technology infrastructure among local restaurants.</p>
    <p class="blockquote">4F&amp;D launched Fork Over: Fast and Free Food Delivery in the fall of 2009 serving 25
      restaurants. 4F&amp;D provided client restaurants with both a technology system to facilitate online orders,
      including processing credit cards, and a third-party delivery service in exchange for a commission for each sale.
      While restaurants were skeptical at first, they also saw that they had little to lose. The commission was on sales
      that they would otherwise not have made. By 2010, the company had a network of more than 500 establishments across
      the city.</p>
    <p class="nonindent"><span class="bold">Time</span></p>
    <p class="blockquote">The pilot will be for one year, starting in 2014. The first three months will include
      implementation of the technology, development of the marketing strategy, an assessment of direct and indirect
      costs for each organization, and a review of menu items.
      <!-- {{tooltip_right}}Time is also an important factor in a proposal. As this document is intended to fund some type of project, the primary parties need a clear explanation of when it begins and when it will end.{{tooltip}}-->
    </p>
    <p class="blockquote">The pilot will run for eight months with the final month used for evaluation of the data. At
      the conclusion of the pilot, all parties have the option of leaving the consortium or staying in for the next
      stage of development.
      <!-- {{tooltip_right}}Budgets are a central feature to proposals but can range from a very simple review of expense and revenue, to a more complex analysis of overhead, to non-direct costs such as benefits for employees who are already on the company payroll. The main goal of the budget is to demonstrate fiscal responsibility and project viability.{{tooltip}}-->
