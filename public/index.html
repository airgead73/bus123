    <p class="blockquote">I wanted to follow up on our meeting earlier today regarding a possible partnership between
      MisMatch and Wine&amp;Dine. We have three advantages in working together. First, we are both new companies and
      need to test our concepts in the marketplace. Second, the services offered by each company are complementary.
      Third, New York is an expensive, if critical, market. By sharing the cost of a media campaign, we can reduce our
      individual cost, while hopefully increasing our membership numbers. Clearly, there are further opportunities to
      work as partners once we assess the success of this program.</p>

    <h2 class="h2">Get Your Content Right</h2>
    <p class="noindent">There&#8217;s a strong impulse when you&#8217;re preparing your slides to include too much
      content. Research has shown that people typically remember only four slides from a twenty-page deck.<sup><a
          epub:type="noteref" id="fn-6" href="15_Chapter06.xhtml#fn_6">&#8727;</a></sup> That&#8217;s not very
      encouraging news if you&#8217;re putting your heart and soul into an informative presentation, but from a
      strategic point of view, it&#8217;s good to know. Rather than packing your presentation full of facts,
      you&#8217;re better off choosing a few key points you want your audience to remember, and organizing the
      presentation around those. Think of your PowerPoint deck as a set <span epub:type="pagebreak"
        id="page_122"></span>of prompts for your performance rather than as a repository for complete
      information.
      <a href="#tooltip6-1" class="tooltip-bold" data-tooltip="trigger">
        <span class="tooltip-icon"></span>
      </a>
    </p>

    <p class="indent">Set up your slides as a visual aid for when you&#8217;re making a speech or presentation, not as a
      trove of data. When presented with a very text-heavy slide, people will typically space out or stop listening and
      read the slide (people can read faster than you can talk). If you want to provide detailed information to your
      audience, you can make and distribute a leave-behind deck that contains your entire talk. For the presentation
      itself, keep your slides concise and the focus on you.</p>


    <h2 class="h2">Case Study: 4F&amp;D, Inc.</h2>
    <p class="noindent">To put the information about proposals in context, we can consider a case study. 4F&amp;D, Inc.
      is a fictional company that operates a series of local food delivery services under the brand Fork Over: Fast and
      Free Food Delivery.</p>
    <p class="indent">Based in Chicago, Illinois, 4F&amp;D, Inc. was founded by Amy Owner in 2008. The company jumped
      into the crowded food-delivery field, where the main competitors were individual restaurants that hired their own
      delivery people to cover a specific territory. 4F&amp;D launched Fork Over: Fast and Free Food Delivery in the
      fall of 2009 serving 25 restaurants. 4F&amp;D provided client restaurants with both a technology system to
      facilitate online orders, including processing credit cards, and a third-party delivery service in exchange for a
      commission for each sale. While restaurants were skeptical at first, they also saw that they had little to lose.
      The commission was on sales that they would otherwise not have made. By 2010, the company had a network of more
      than 500 establishments across the city.</p>
    <p class="indent">As reaching neighborhoods further away from the city center became more difficult, Amy saw an
      opportunity to expand her business model to serve small communities that could not support high-volume trade. Fork
      Over launched a pilot program in Boise, Idaho, in 2013. To ascertain whether the new business model is viable,
      Amy&#8217;s team created a report on the short- and long-term prospects of the Boise Pilot program. Now Amy wants
      to explore the possibility of creating partnerships with local client restaurants as a precursor to obtaining
      venture capital funding for a regional and then national rollout of Fork Over: Fast and Free Food Delivery.</p>
    <p class="indent">The following is the executive summary from the team&#8217;s proposal.
      <a href="#tooltip6-2" class="tooltip-bold" data-tooltip="trigger">
        <span class="tooltip-icon"></span>
      </a></p>
    <p class="nonindent<p clcontentote">
      4F&amp;D is a successful company that works with local restaurants to increase sales, build customer loyalty and
      demand, and ensure timely food delivery. The food delivery and takeout industry represents a substantial portion
      of food sales annually. According to data from Statista, 60 percent of consumers in the United States ordered
      takeout or delivery at least once a week—only 2 percent said that they never ordered it at all. The study also
      found the following: </p>
    <p class="list">1.<span class="space" />Generally, men ordered more often than women.</p>
    <p class="list">2.<span class="space" />In 2013, pizza was the most popular type of food for takeout or delivery,
      with almost three quarters of consumers stating that they ordered it via the Internet or an app.</p>
    <p class="list">3.<span class="space" />In the same year, consumers spent more than US &#36;32 billion in the quick
      service pizza restaurant sector.</p>
    <p class="list">4.<span class="space" />Carry-out pizza made up US &#36;14.6 billion of this figure, and delivery
      pizza accounted for almost US &#36;10 billion.</p>
    <p class="list">5.<span class="space" />As of February 2014, Papa Murphy&#8217;s was the favorite pizza restaurant
      of more than two thirds of Americans, followed by Pizza Ranch and Papa John&#8217;s.</p>
    <p class="list">6.<span class="space" />Restaurant delivery and takeout is not just limited to pizza: Other popular
      foods include sandwiches, burgers, Chinese food, chicken wings, and Mexican food.</p>
    <p class="list">7.<span class="space" />A third of consumers stated that they revisit their most-frequented
      restaurant because of the availability of takeout.</p>

      http://www.statista.com/statistics/218712/takeout-or-delivery-spending-in-the-us/</p>
    <p class="blockquote">While many of these food establishments represent the traditional fare that consumers are used
      to ordering, such as pizza, Chinese, diner fare, and Mexican, the numbers also demonstrate that consumers are
      willing and ready to order online for delivery. The market is large, the profits are demonstrable, and the
      opportunity exists to push online ordering and food delivery in a new direction.</p>

    <p class="blockquote">
      4F&amp;D proposes to create a pilot operation with 10 restaurants in the Boise area that currently do not have
      delivery options. Working as partners, each party will agree to honor a radical departure from traditional online
      ordering and home delivery options. Keep in mind that 10 years ago people did not order food online, and today
      more than three quarters do. Markets move rapidly, and consumers are increasingly demanding what they want when
      they want it.</p>
    <p class="blockquote">The new service, A la Carte to Home, will allow customers to order single menu items from any
      of the participating restaurants at prices that offer a discount from the stated menu pricing. 4F&amp;D will
      install and absorb the cost for the technology ordering and payment system to be modified for taxes on A la Carte
      items. The consortium will contribute an equal pro-rated amount for a citywide marketing campaign.</p>
    <p class="blockquote">We further propose that A la Carte to Home be a model for additional expansion beyond Boise.
      The original participants will be given the opportunity to receive royalty payments as part of the partnership.
      The goal is to create a viable model that can be rolled out regionally and then nationally with venture capital
      funding. This pilot will serve as proof that the concept can work.</p>

      food-delivery field, where the main competitors were individual restaurants that hired their own delivery people
      to cover a specific territory. At times, restaurants sometimes pooled their deliveries with neighboring
      establishments. Amy realized that the market was ready for a new kind of service that could take advantage of
      cooperative deliveries by creating a technology infrastructure among local restaurants.</p>

    <p class="blockquote">The pilot will be for one year, starting in 2014. The first three months will include

        <p class="indents-n">Language clarity is the key in communicating with a reader. Writers want to establish
          direct cause and effect relationships, or otherwise explain the logic behind an issue clearly and
          systematically. Writers also want to avoid unclear referents, such as in the case of the first example, in
          which the referent &#8220;They&#8221; was unclear. Whomever or whatever you are referring to should always be
          obvious. Make sure that you ascribe the action of the sentence to one single subject.</p>

      Here, we have two possible subjects, the PTA and the school. Either of these two groups
      could have voted in favor of the soda machine, but the sentence does not clarify which did the
      voting.

      Using &#8220;the reason&#8221; and &#8220;because&#8221; is on sentence should be avoided because it is
      repetitive. Also, there is a lack of logical clarity in this particular sentence. Is the reason why the car broke
      down that the oil is leaking? Why is the oil leaking? That is the real &#8220;reason&#8221; for the problem.

      While it may seem obvious, it is critical to list the team members and the scope of the project upfront. The
      action plan acts as a map. The more complex the project, the more important it is to track who is doing what.
    </div>

    <div id="tooltip9-2" class="tooltip" data-tooltip="content">
      The mission statement is often overlooked as part of the team-building process. However, it is the bridge that
      connects the team’s objectives to that of the organization.

    <div id="tooltip9-3" class="tooltip" data-tooltip="content">
      Projects will vary in complexity, but using the right tool can dramatically affect the workflow of the team. New
      collaborative tools are introduced frequently, so it is important to keep evaluating what works best.

    <div id="tooltip9-4" class="tooltip" data-tooltip="content">
      Part of the early planning stage for any project should include a complete inventory of talent, whether it seems
      relevant or not. Asking members to submit their résumés is a good place to start assessing interests, knowledge,
      and talent.

    <div id="tooltip9-5" class="tooltip" data-tooltip="content">
      The agenda is a key organizing document. Not only does it outline what will be discussed or decided; it can also
      serve as the outline for taking minutes of the meeting.

      It is not uncommon that teams are fatigued by the time they reach the end stages. However, the final product is
      the only thing that management will see or is likely to care about. Close, meticulous review is necessary to
      ensure the entire project is not dismissed as sloppy.
