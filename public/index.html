      for our new partnership. As you know, our dating service MisMatch and your Wine&amp;Dine
      service can leverage

    <p class="blockquote">Dear Dee,</p>
    <p class="blockquote">I wanted to follow up on our meeting earlier today regarding a possible partnership
      between
      MisMatch and Wine&amp;Dine. We have three advantages in working together. First, we are both new companies
      and
      need to test our concepts in the marketplace. Second, the services offered by each company are
      complementary.
      Third, New York is an expensive, if critical, market. By sharing the cost of a media campaign, we can reduce
      our
      individual cost, while hopefully increasing our membership numbers. Clearly, there are further opportunities
      to
      work as partners once we assess the success of this program.</p>
