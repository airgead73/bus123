    <p class="blockquote">Dear Dee,</p>
    <p class="blockquote">I wanted to follow up on our meeting earlier today regarding a possible partnership between
      MisMatch and Wine&amp;Dine. We have three advantages in working together. First, we are both new companies and
      need to test our concepts in the marketplace. Second, the services offered by each company are complementary.
      Third, New York is an expensive, if critical, market. By sharing the cost of a media campaign, we can reduce our
      individual cost, while hopefully increasing our membership numbers. Clearly, there are further opportunities to
      work as partners once we assess the success of this program.</p>
